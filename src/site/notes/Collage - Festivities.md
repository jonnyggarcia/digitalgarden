**Context**: Part of the challenge of moving alone to another country is coming to terms with the realization that I'll miss out on many important moments I wished to be a part of. I missed birthdays, weddings, couldn't witness the growth of my nephew and niece, and was unable to spend time with my friends. These absences weighed heavily on me, serving as constant reminders of the sacrifices made in pursuit of a new life abroad.
