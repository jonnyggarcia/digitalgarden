The **Regra de 3** (Rule of 3) is performed in a distant closed position, where the couple takes three steps together, with the follower pivoting 180 degrees on the third step. This move can begin with either a regular entry—where the follower faces the same direction as the lead—or a reversed entry, in which the lead and follower face each other. In the reversed entry, the follower walks backward.

**Lead**
1. Perform the opening for [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. The weight will be on your left leg.
2. Take a right step forward.
3. Take a left step forward while pivoting the follower. Use the bottom of your right hand against the follower’s side to initiate the follower’s pivot. You and the follower should be facing the direction you came from. Then, provide the intention for the follower to walk forward.
4. Take a right step forward.
5. Take a left step forward.
6. Take a right step forward while pivoting the follower. Use the tips of your right-hand fingers to pull the follower in and initiate the pivot. Then, provide the intention for the follower to walk forward.
7. You can repeat from step 2.

**Followers**
1. The lead will pivot your body to the right, as in [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. The weight should be on the right foot.
2. Take a left step forward.
3. Take a right step forward. Using the bottom of their right hand, the lead will pivot your body 180 degrees to the left. You and the lead should be facing the direction you came from.
4. Take a left step forward.
5. Take a right step forward.
6. Take a left step forward. Using their right fingertips, the lead will pivot your body 180 degrees to the right. You and the lead should be facing the direction you came from.
7. Keep repeating from step 2. until the lead closed the movement lie in Passeio.

*Closing*
1. On step 6, perform a Basic 2 to the right.

**Variation**
- Leads, instead of opening the follower like in Passeio, use your right-hand fingers to push them inward, causing them to face you. The couple will be side by side, facing each other.
- After that, you can perform a regular Regra de 3, but the follower will walk backward instead of forward.
- The pivot is initiated by the lead’s chest.
- The follower’s left hand needs to slide across the lead’s back when they are pivoting to the left, otherwise, they will prevent the lead from initiating the pivot.

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead must perform the pivot and provide intention to the follower so they know they need to walk.
