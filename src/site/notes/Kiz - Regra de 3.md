The **Regra de 3** (Rule of 3) is performed in a distant closed position, where the couple takes three steps together, with the follower pivoting 180 degrees on the third step. This move can begin with either a regular entry—where the follower faces the same direction as the lead—or a reversed entry, in which the lead and follower face each other. In the reversed entry, the follower walks backward.
