**Retrocesso** (setback/regression, the opposite of progression) is a connected move that utilizes syncopation. It involves the lead moving backward and performing a 180-degree turn. The turn can be in either direction, but it is more commonly performed to the left. This is a very important step used for connection.

The term for syncopation in Kizomba is **contratempo**.

**Lead**
1. The lead pivots the chest to the left while taking a backward step with the right foot, performing a 90-degree turn.
2. Step to the left on the beat.
3. Collect the right foot off beat (contratempo).
4. Step forward with the left foot, performing a 90-degree turn.
5. Perform a basic 2 to the right, as in a Basic 2 (marca).

There are three possible ways the lead can enter into retrocesso:

- **GC03.01** - Back step: From the right side of closed position, the lead steps back with the left foot.
- **GC03.02** - Basic 2: From the left side of closed position.
- **GC03.03** - Balance: Step forward with the left foot, balance. This is used to perform several retrocessos in a row. This entry is similar to the key element of [[Kiz - Triângulo\|Triângulo]].

**Follower**
1. Take a left step forward turning to the left. The turning comes from the lead's chest movement.
2. Take a right step to the side on the beat
3. Collect the left step off beat (contratempo) and transfer the weight.
4. Take right step back turning to the left. The turning comes from the lead's chest movement.
5. Perform a basic 2 to the left, as in a Basic 2 (marca).
