**Retrocesso** (backstep/setback) is a connected move that utilizes syncopation. It involves the lead moving backward and performing a 180-degree turn. The turn can be in either direction, but it is more commonly performed to the left. This is a very important step used for connection.

The term for syncopation in Kizomba is **contratempo**.

**Lead**
1. The lead pivots the chest to the left while taking a backward step with the right foot, performing a 90-degree turn.
2. Step to the left on the beat.
3. Close the right foot off beat (contratempo).
4. Step forward with the left foot, performing a 90-degree turn.
5. Close the right foot, as in a Basic 2 (marca).

There are three possible ways the lead can enter into retrocesso:

- **Entry 1:** From the right side of closed position, the lead steps back with the left foot.
- **Entry 2:** From the left side of closed position.
- **Entry 3:** Step forward with the left foot, balance. This is used to perform several retrocessos in a row. This entry is similar to the key element of [[Kiz - Diamante\|Diamante]].
- As a blending exercise, the lead can perform a [[Kiz - Quadrado\|Quadrado]] lead into Retrocesso on the right step backward during step 3.

*Key elements of the move*
- The most important element is the chest pivot on step 1.
- The lead must keep the follower close and not lose their right hand; otherwise, the follower won't notice the chest pivoting.
