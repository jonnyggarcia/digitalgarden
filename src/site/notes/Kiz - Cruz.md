**Cruz** (cross) is a variation of [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]], involving a change of direction every 6 steps. There are two patterns when performing this move: both the lead and follower walking forward, or the lead walking forward while the follower walks backward. It is also possible to alternate the pattern every 6 steps.

---

**Walking Forward - Lead**
1. You start the movement facing north.
2. Perform a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]]. This is a walk to the left, or toward the east.
3. On the 6th step (3rd step back), use your right hand to rotate the follower 180 degrees to their right. Both of you should be facing the same direction, or toward the north. The follower will be on your right side.
4. Perform another **Regra de 3** toward the north.
5. Repeat from Step 2, changing the direction to the west and then to the south.

**Walking Forward - Followers**
1. You start the movement facing south.
2. The lead will signal a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]], during which you will be walking to your right or toward the east.
3. On the 6th step, the lead will use their right hand resting on your back to pivot your chest 180 degrees to the right. Now you should be facing the opposite direction (south), with the lead on your left side.
4. The lead will signal another **Regra de 3** by walking forward or toward the north.
5. The lead will repeat from Step 2, changing the direction to the west and then to the south.

**Walking Backward - Lead**
1. You start the movement facing north.
2. Perform a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]] using variation where the follower walks backward.
3. On the 6th step (3rd step back), use your right hand to rotate the follower 90 degrees to the left. You should be facing north, while the follower will be facing south, placing them on your right side.
4. Perform another **Regra de 3** toward the north.
5. Repeat from Step 2, changing the direction to the west and then to the south.

**Walking Backward - Follower**
1. You start the movement facing south.
2. The lead will signal a **Regra de 3** using a variation where you walk backward.
3. On the 6th step, the lead will use their right hand resting on your back to pivot your chest 90 degrees to the left. You should now be facing the opposite direction (south), with the lead on your right side.
4. The lead will signal another **Regra de 3** by walking forward, or toward the north, while you continue walking backward.
5. The lead will repeat from Step 2, changing the direction to the west and then to the south.

**Alternated Walking**
- The lead will alternate between a regular **Regra de 3** (forward) and a reversed **Regra de 3** (backward).

---

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead must be clear about the pivoting in Step 2.
- After the pivot, the lead must provide forward or backward momentum to signal the follower to walk.
