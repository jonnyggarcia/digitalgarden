The **Side Opening** is a variation of [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] where, instead of both partners moving in the same direction (to the left from the lead's perspective), the lead moves to the right while the follower moves to the left as in the regular basic 2.

The lead needs to slightly disconnect from the follower and transfer their weight to the left foot in order to step to the right. At the same time, they should indicate to the follower that nothing has changed by gently pushing them to the left.
