Side opening is a variation of [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] where instead both partners move to the same direction (left from the lead perspective), the lead moves to the right, whereas the follower moves to the left as per the regular basic 2.

The lead needs to disconnect slightly from the follower and transfer their weight to the left foot, so they can step right. At the same, they should indicate to the follower that nothing is change by pushing them to the left.
