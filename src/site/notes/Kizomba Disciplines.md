In some dances, if the lead is not strong, the couple can still manage and have an okay dance. However, in Kizomba, this becomes more challenging. Due to the close proximity between partners and the lack of a predetermined basic step to default to, if the lead is not strong, the dance is unlikely to flow well.

In Kizomba, Leads and Followers have different responsibilities that require distinct skill sets. The Lead’s role is to provide clear signals to communicate intention and direction, while the Follower’s role is to interpret these signals and respond accordingly. For more details, please refer to the [[Principles of Kizomba\|Principles of Kizomba]].

# Followers

Followers have one main job: to learn how to follow. But what does that really mean? In everyday life, both Leads and Followers often respond to others’ requests or directions. For example, when someone asks you for a glass of water and you fetch it, you’re following their suggestion. Being a Follower means responding promptly to a suggestion or direction.

In dance, this means that any instructions the Follower receives regarding movement should be acknowledged and carried out smoothly. If the Lead signals the Follower to move forward, the Follower should move forward. This doesn’t mean the Lead must force any action; instead, the Lead invites, and the Follower chooses to respond.

When people say, “just follow,” I find it overly simplistic. Following requires developing several key skills.

1. **Physical Listening**
2. **Reaction**
3. **Entrusting the Guidance**

Learning a partner dance is similar to learning a new language. It’s a shared code that both partners must understand to enable clear communication. No one is born knowing how to speak a particular language; we learn to make sounds, combine them into words, and understand their meanings to form sentences. Communication can happen even without spoken language; in games like charades, there’s no formal code, so we guess based on nonverbal cues.

Learning to dance is about developing fluency in body language. Each style of dance is like a different dialect, but the underlying language is the same: body movement. The Follower’s role is to learn this new language—to respond to specific cues, which vary by dance style, though some skills are transferable across styles.

**Physical Listening** is the ability to tune into what is happening within your own body. Followers need to be highly attuned to their bodies to recognize and interpret each subtle cue. What are you feeling in the moment? During a dance, multiple things happen simultaneously. The Lead provides signals that require both interpretation and reaction. For example, when the Lead steps backward, their right hand, resting on the Follower’s back, will press gently as they move back. This change in pressure is a signal for the Follower; here, the pressure indicates that the Follower should move forward. Once a signal is perceived, the Follower’s role is to respond accordingly.

The first step for the Follower is to learn the possible signals the Lead may use in the dance. There is a finite set of these signals. Here are some common ones and examples of where they might be applied:

**Hand Signals**

- **Pressure**: Adjusting the amount of pressure, either increasing or decreasing. (e.g., Basic 3)
- **Pivoting**: Rotational guidance to indicate turns or shifts. (e.g., Basic 3)
- **Upward and Downward Movements**: Vertical signals, such as lifting or lowering hands. (e.g., Leg Raises)
- **Push and Pull**: Gentle pushing or pulling motions to direct movement. (e.g., Basic 2)

These four signals can convey different meanings depending on the moment, so it’s the Follower’s job to understand what each cue signifies in various contexts. Here is a list of body parts through which Followers can receive signals from the Lead:

- **Chest**
- **Back**
- **Right Hand**
- **Legs**

For more experienced dancers, Kizomba can feel distinct in its use of the legs as a source of input—especially for those coming from salsa, where most cues are received from the upper body.

The [[How to improve certainty as a follower\|Acknowledgment Exercise]] I developed is the first step in learning what the signals are and their basic meanings—specifically, how the Follower is supposed to respond.

**Reaction** is the ability to act without overthinking. During a dance, the Follower will receive numerous signals indicating how they should respond. It’s the Follower’s responsibility to interpret these signals and react accordingly, though this is a skill developed over time.

Initially, reaction time may be slow, as the Follower must think through the response. With enough practice, however, the body will instinctively react to each signal. Practicing Physical Listening involves recognizing what is happening in your body and learning to respond effectively. Most signals in Kizomba are intuitive—such as moving side to side, forward, or backward. Some, however, are less intuitive, like those involving the legs. Starting with step 4 of the Acknowledgment Exercise, the Follower works on identifying the intention behind the Lead’s cues, gradually progressing to instinctive action.

The most challenging aspect of being a Follower is learning to **Entrust the Guidance**. Followers are not responsible for deciding what happens next; they are there to “surf the wave.” In many areas of life, we all find ourselves in situations where we need to follow directions. For example, if my boss assigns a task related to my job, I’m expected to carry it out as requested. This doesn’t mean they have the right to be rude or disrespectful, but it is my role to follow their direction.

In partner dance, the dynamic is similar. The Lead is responsible for deciding what happens next, and the Follower’s role is to go along with that decision. If the Follower chooses not to follow the Lead’s signal, it will likely disrupt the dance. Of course, there are moments when the Follower may not fully understand what they’re supposed to do next, which can lead to confusion—but that’s a different challenge altogether.

**Entrusting the Guidance** means letting go of decision-making and allowing the Lead to determine what comes next. However, this doesn’t mean that Followers are under the Lead’s absolute control; they have an active role. They must perceive each signal and perform the expected movement. This principle applies across all partner dances.

In Kizomba, some Followers struggle to follow smoothly, often saying it’s because they can’t “turn off” their minds. They may find themselves anticipating or backleading. In other dances, this may lead them to perform unplanned movements, but the dance can still flow. In Kizomba, however, the close proximity and lack of repetitive patterns mean that when a Follower does something unexpected, it creates dissonance in the dance. Ultimately, Kizomba brings attention to habits, like anticipating, that may have gone unnoticed in other dance styles.

In fact, the issue of predicting and backleading isn’t strictly a Follower problem; it’s a byproduct of how most dance classes are structured. In nearly every Latin or Kizomba dance class I’ve attended, the setup is similar: the group is split, with Followers and Leads on opposite sides of the room, and the instructor teaches the footwork to both. While this approach makes sense for Leads (more on that later), it can be counterproductive for Followers.

Teaching the footwork first often means Followers are learning a set sequence of steps to memorize. This approach can work if the Follower can recognize exactly when to apply those steps. However, in Kizomba, a Lead might only use part of a movement, such as beginning the entry for a Woman Saída but finishing with a Retrocesso. In this case, the Follower may recognize the Woman Saída pattern and automatically default to the memorized footwork, only to become confused when the Lead switches to the Retrocesso. Despite knowing both moves independently, the Follower may feel lost.

Instead of learning fixed step sequences, Followers should be trained to respond to signals with singular reactions, each based on the Lead’s cues. This approach encourages adaptability and reduces dependence on memorized patterns. More on this in the article [[Model vs. Developmental System\|Model vs. Developmental System]].

**Entrusting the Guidance** is not about letting go and being submissive; it’s about fully embracing the Follower’s role by practicing physical listening with precision and a quick response time. In my opinion, this role can be more challenging than leading, as Followers must be fully engaged and ready to respond seamlessly.

For some Followers, especially those with prior dance experience, the idea of allowing the Lead to move them may feel unfamiliar. One of the key challenges in physical listening is learning to avoid resisting and to cooperate without second-guessing oneself. It’s natural to feel resistant or to hold one’s ground, especially in new situations—many of us naturally resist sudden changes. But Followers must learn to let the Lead move their bodies. If the Lead moves forward, for instance, the Follower should allow themselves to be moved backward, assisting by moving backward as well.

The best Followers are those who feel “light” to dance with; they acknowledge each signal and follow it intentionally. This skill is also developed in the [[How to improve certainty as a follower\|Acknowledgment Exercise]] starting at step 6, where the focus shifts to attentiveness and prompt response to each new signal.

Lastly, one of the fundamental concepts in Kizomba is weight transfer. Most steps in Kizomba require both Leads and Followers to fully commit their weight with each step. There are exceptions, such as when performing a Marca, but generally, it is each dancer’s responsibility to commit their weight fully and maintain balance. By fully committing to each step, you will have only one leg available for the next step, which helps minimize potential errors. Incomplete weight transfer makes moves like leg fishing more difficult to execute. The [[Kizomba Exercises#Balanced Walk Exercise\|Balanced Walk Exercise]] is designed to develop precise, balanced movement in response to varying cues.

Despite all of this, the only way to truly learn is through practice—and lots of it. Being a Follower is not an easy task, and it requires dedicated, consistent practice.

# Leads

Kizomba Leads have more tasks to manage compared to Followers, but this doesn’t mean that Followers have an easier role. During a dance, Leads need to handle the following responsibilities:

- **Make a Decision**: Decide on the next move while simultaneously executing the current one.
- **Guide the Follower**: Lead the chosen move with clarity and precision.
- **Tempo**: Stay in time with the music.
- **Musicality**: Dance with a sense of rhythm and expression, moving to the music rather than simply executing steps.

**Make a Decision**

Leads are responsible for deciding the next step, so the more steps a Lead knows, the more options they have. However, a larger repertoire doesn’t necessarily make for a better dancer. Leads must always complete one step before starting another. This doesn’t mean performing an entire Woman Saída before moving into a Retrocesso—these moves can be broken down and combined in various ways. However, the Lead must finish each step by fully committing their weight before transitioning to the next. Rushing into the next move often happens when Leads are trying to keep up with the tempo.

**Guide de follower**

From the Lead’s perspective, it’s crucial to master two things: the footwork itself and how to lead it. If the Lead is uncertain of the steps, the Follower won’t know what to do either. For example, when performing a Man Saída, the Lead takes three steps forward and one step to the right, followed by a Marca. These steps must be executed with confidence, assertiveness, and no hesitation.

While the traditional approach to learning footwork is an essential step in the Lead’s journey, it’s only the beginning. Once a footwork pattern is learned, the Lead must practice it repeatedly until they can execute it confidently and without hesitation. After establishing this foundation, the Lead must then focus on communicating their intentions clearly. This means providing unambiguous signals, and direction so that the Follower can respond accurately.

In other dances, like Salsa, both Leads and Followers often learn footwork individually before partnering. Therefore, a Lead with prior dance experience may assume that the Follower will simply know what to do next—but this shouldn’t be the mindset. As the Lead, it’s your responsibility to offer clear signals so that the Follower understands each step and what’s coming next.

While the following is learning Physical Listening, the lead is supposed to learn Physical Awareness. That means the Lead needs to learn how to be aware of what is necessary to make the follower to take a specific step. If you want a follower to perform a step forward, how do you communicate that only using your body?

> [!info] How can I provide clear instructions so the Follower knows what to do?​

In terms of leading, every move consists of an intention, a signal, and sometimes a direction:

- **Intention**: *What do you want to achieve?*
- **Signal**: *How do you communicate that?*
- **Direction**: *Where do you want to go?*

For example, let’s say the Lead has the intention to perform a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]]. To do so, they need to turn 90 degrees to the left and use their right hand to guide the Follower, moving them like a door hinge. These actions create the signals necessary for this movement. Then, both will walk forward, which is the next intention. The Lead should use their hand firmly against the Follower’s back, applying consistent pressure as they walk. This pressure serves as the signal, allowing the Follower to sense the movement and respond accordingly.

The Lead needs to learn all the possible signals they can provide, which are typically communicated through the limbs and the chest. Among these, the chest and the right hand are the most common ways to communicate with the Follower. The [[How to improve certainty as a follower\|Acknowledgment Exercise]] and the [[Kizomba Exercises#Placement Exercise\|Placement Exercise]] are designed to teach how to provide various stimuli to the Follower.

**Tempo**

At the beginning, finding the beat can be challenging, especially if the Lead is not familiar with the music being played. Kizomba encompasses various genres, some of which make it easier to find the beat (like Ghetto Zouk), while others (such as Coladeira) can be more complex.

The best remedy for this is to listen to Kizomba songs as much as possible. The more attentive you are while listening to the music, the better. If you’re listening to songs while doing something else, your focus won’t be fully on the music. To improve, you need to dedicate your full attention to each song. Start by trying to find the beat; listen for a sound that consistently repeats at regular intervals—this is likely your tempo. Additionally, pay attention to when your body naturally moves in response to the music; this can help you identify the sounds that indicate the beat.

**Musicality**

Developing musicality is one of the hardest aspects of dancing. First, the Lead must be fully confident in their steps and how to lead each move. If they are preoccupied with executing the steps correctly, they may struggle to incorporate musicality effectively. The more familiar you are with a song, the better you can integrate musicality into your dancing. If your local DJ has published sets or playlists, make an effort to listen to them as often as possible.

Dancing on the beat is the first step toward enhancing your musicality. Once you can dance on the beat, you’ll notice that there are certain moments in the song where the beat is absent—particularly at the beginning and end, but sometimes in the middle as well. During these moments, you will typically only hear the melody and, occasionally, the vocals. That is when you should perform Basic 1. As soon as you realize the beat has disappeared, shift to Basic 1 to maintain the flow of the dance.

Next, try to anticipate when the music is about to change, which usually occurs on beat 8. This shift is often indicated by instruments introducing variations that signal the approach of beat 1. At these moments, the Lead can perform moves that emphasize the music.

When we listen to music, we tend to focus on the vocals and memorize the lyrics. Try to notice the patterns of when the singer is about to sing and when they pause. Once you can predict when the voice will come in, perform moves with more intensity and movement. When the voice disappears, shift to steps that are more localized or of lower intensity.

Additionally, during singing, there are variations in tonality. Sometimes the singer stretches a word or alters their vocal quality. Represent these changes in your body. For example, if the singer stretches a word, you can perform a Reverencia. When the singer repeats the same word multiple times, consider using a [[Kiz - Tic Tac\|Tic Tac]] to emphasize it.

Moving on from the vocals, you can apply the same concepts by following different instruments. For example, listen to the song [**Lembranças by Ivan Alekxei**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0DkQs67F405gul8acgMKCJ?si=a8a72daec879478f). In the first 18 seconds, a constant percussion instrument plays while the guitar strums a few strings at regular intervals. Try to move only when you hear the guitar.

In [**Criol é Bitche by Jenifer Solidade**](https://open.spotify.com/track/44D8pLVaXbLd8ApmeLirha?si=0db06436b4e64582), you can clearly hear a strong beat at around three seconds; emphasize that by performing a Marca. In the beginning of [**Sincera by Pérola**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NWmCfSGPY4iZgXjOtH5Vv?si=64c515f9a04d46b2), you can hear her voice and a musical instrument being played one after the other, but not simultaneously. You can choose to follow the voice and move only when she sings, or you can decide to follow the melody and only move when you hear it.

Another aspect you can develop regarding musicality is the ability to play with tempo while executing steps. For instance, you can perform any move using two beats for each step. Try executing a regular Woman Saída, and then try it again, taking two beats for each step.

Followers may get confused by this change because they are accustomed to following the beat. Therefore, it’s essential for the Lead to provide extra indications that you are doing something different.

# Strategies

The best way to improve is to dance, but more often than not, social dancing is not the ideal environment for enhancement. To truly get better, focused practice is essential. While social dancing is our ultimate goal, you don’t want to repeat the same move over and over with the same partner until both of you have mastered it. At social events, the objective is to dance and have fun. For Leads, it’s best to stick to the moves you are most familiar with.

Find a dance partner! Try to find someone you can practice with regularly, at least once a week. The time spent with that person outside of social settings is an opportunity to refine your movements and develop better body coordination and awareness. When you practice, have a specific goal in mind. Discuss with your partner and select three to five moves to focus on. Repeat each move until you feel confident.

Followers, always provide feedback to your Leads. Are you feeling the intention, the signal, and the direction in every move? If not, communicate this to your Lead and discuss what can be done to make it clearer.

Start by dancing without music until you have a good grasp of the move. Once you feel comfortable, play a song and incorporate the new move alongside the others. Did the follower understand and react as expected? If not, what was the issue? Were the signals clear? There’s no need to dance for an entire song; aim for about a minute and a half, then take a moment to discuss the dance.

Next, play a completely different song and try again. Alternate between various genres such as Semba, Kizomba, Coladeira, Ghetto Zouk, and more. If you need a playlist, check [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4vCODB1vWVWzpaxpPJGLvW?si=06d58ddf34014424). Once you feel comfortable with the move, move on to the next one.

Additionally, if you planned to work on five moves, there’s no need to rush through all of them. Take the time you need to master each step. If you don’t get through the entire list, save it for your next practice session.

For the Leads, it’s quite common to go social dancing and default to the same steps they always perform, forgetting to try new ones. When heading out to social dance, create a short list of 3 to 5 steps that you’ve been working on. Before inviting someone to dance, select one of those moves—only one—and try to incorporate it into the dance twice, but not consecutively.

After that, attempt the same move with new partners. Once you successfully execute the move six times, choose another one from your list. Note that these moves should be familiar to you; you should feel comfortable with them. Avoid choosing a move that you haven’t practiced enough. If you cannot complete six executions, you’ll know what to focus on during your next practice session with your dance partner.

> [!info] Prioritize small progress over big ones.

Leads, remember that a good dance is not about executing all the moves you know. It’s about establishing a connection with your partner and embodying musicality. If the follower leaves the dance feeling like they could follow your lead with ease, they are likely to want to dance with you again. If they notice that you are executing steps in sync with the music, they will perceive you as a good Lead.

On the other hand, if you perform flashy moves, such as dips or leg fishing, while the follower feels completely lost, they are probably not going to be interested in dancing with you again. They may think they are a bad follower (which is the worst-case scenario) or conclude that you are not a good Lead (the better-case scenario). Either way, you want to create a positive dancing experience. Stick to what you know, and occasionally introduce something new to keep things interesting.
