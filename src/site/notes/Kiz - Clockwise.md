**Clockwise** is a connected step where the lead starts by walking forward, then performs a 180-degree turn to the right or left, and finishes by walking backward. This move is commonly concluded with a [[Kiz - Balance\|Balance]]. There are two variations of this move:

**Variation 1**
1. The lead steps forward with the left foot; the follower steps backward with the right foot.
2. The lead steps with the right foot, turning 45 degrees to the right.
3. The lead steps with the left foot, completing a 90-degree turn to the right. At this point, the lead has turned 90 degrees from their starting position.
4. The lead steps back with the right foot, turning another 45 degrees.
5. The lead steps back with the left foot, completing a 90-degree turn. At this point, the lead has turned 180 degrees from their starting position.
6. The lead steps back with the right foot.
7. Finish with a balance in place.

**Variation 2**

This variation requires more momentum and a sharper turn.

1. The lead steps forward with the left foot; the follower steps backward with the right foot.
3. The lead steps with the left foot, completing a 90-degree turn to the right.
4. The lead steps back with the right foot, completing a 90-degree turn. At this point, the lead has turned 180 degrees from their starting position.
5. The lead steps back with the left foot.
7. Finish with a balance in place.

*Key elements of the move*
- The turn is made to the right or left using the opposite leg (i.e., the left foot to turn right, and the right foot to turn left). This is for the variation 2.
