**Bate e Volta** (bumper car) is a disconnected movement where the follower turns back and forth.

**Lead**
1. Open with a [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]] and perform a right shoulder flick, tossing the follower's left arm up.
2. Use the right hand to turn the follower to the right. Catch the follower's shoulder blade with the left hand.
3. Use the left hand to stop the follower's momentum, then push them forward, causing them to rotate to the left. Before pushing the follower forward, the couple is supposed to be facing the same direction.
4. Catch the follower's shoulder blade with the right hand.
5. With the right hand, stop the follower's momentum, then push them forward, causing them to rotate to the right.
6. Catch the follower's shoulder blade with the left hand.
7. Repeat from step 3.
8. To exit the movement, when performing step 3, give extra energy so the follower can rotate more. Intercept the follower's back with the right hand.
9. Close with a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the right or with a [[Kiz - Woman Saída\|Woman Saída]].

**Follower**
1. The lead will open the follower’s body 90 degrees with a [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. The weight will be on the follower’s right foot.
2. Take a step forward with the left foot, turning to the right. The turn is guided by the lead’s hand on the follower’s back.
3. Take a step backward with the right foot. The follower should feel the lead’s hand on their shoulder blade, which reduces the momentum and prevents continued rotation.
4. Take a step forward with the right foot, turning to the left. The lead will push the follower forward, causing them to rotate.
5. Take a step backward with the left foot. The follower should feel the lead’s hand on their shoulder blade, which reduces the momentum and prevents continued rotation.
6. Take a step forward with the left foot, turning to the right. The lead will push the follower forward, causing them to rotate.
7. Repeat from step 3.
8. When performing step 3, the lead will provide extra energy to exit the move.
9. Close with a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the left or a [[Kiz - Woman Saída\|Woman Saída]].

*Key elements of the move*

- The lead needs to provide enough momentum for the follower to spin and step back.
- When the lead intercepts the follower’s back, they need to stop the momentum and then send the follower in the opposite direction.
