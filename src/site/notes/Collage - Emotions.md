**Context:** This collage was a tentative to use abstraction. A hand that is trying to reach feelings that are locked away. The abstract background is to express the inside of my mind, which is emphasized bay the diagonal black lines. The lines represent the cast shadow of the bars of a window. This is about my difficulty to express my feelings and emotions, making myself a prisoner. This collage is also part of the series Abstract.
