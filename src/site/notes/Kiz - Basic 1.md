**Basic 1** consists of weight transfers from side to side. This move is typically performed over 2 beats of music and is often used when there is no strong beat.

The lead should indicate the movement with their right hand, resting on the follower's back, by gently pressing the upper part of the hand against the follower's back and then releasing. This movement should be synchronized with the weight transfer.
