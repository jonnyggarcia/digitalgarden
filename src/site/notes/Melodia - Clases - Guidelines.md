Hi everyone,

I am excited to have you as part of Melodia and the Kizomba community! As we continue to grow and create an inspiring space for learning and connection, I’ve put together a set of class guidelines to help keep things respectful, welcoming, and fun for everyone.

These guidelines cover:

- Respect for the class and each other
- Partner rotation
- Communication & consent
- Focus and participation

Please take a few moments to review them before our next class. They’re designed to ensure everyone feels comfortable, supported, and able to grow.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. I am here to support you on your Kizomba journey.

Thank you for helping me build a safe and respectful dance environment. See you on the dance floor!

Jonny

# Guidelines

 1. **Respect The Class and Each Other**

- Arrive on time to the best of your ability, and stay for the full 2 hours whenever possible.
- Be open-minded toward the exercises and willing to engage fully. Ask questions when you need clarification.
- Be excellent to one another: stay courteous, patient, and kind with your partners.
- Maintain good personal hygiene; clean clothing, deodorant, and fresh breath are appreciated.
- Sexual or sensual behaviour (verbal or physical) is not tolerated. Keep the environment respectful and safe for all.  If it’s not something you’d say or do in front of your grandparent, it doesn’t belong here.

2. **Partner Rotation**

- We rotate partners regularly to encourage adaptability and build a sense of community.
- If you prefer to stay with one partner, please let the instructor know respectfully at the beginning of class.

3. **Communication & Consent**

- Always ask before initiating a dance during social time or outside of class.
- If something feels uncomfortable, speak up or talk to the instructor privately.
- You can decline a dance for any reason; NO explanation is required.
- Respect anyone’s decision to say no. Don’t ask why. A simple “thank you” is always enough.

4. **Focus & Participation**

- Stay present during instruction. Save side conversations for breaks or after class.
- Be open to feedback — regardless of who it’s from — and ask questions if you’re unsure.
- During practice time, focus on learning and improving, not just completing the steps.
- Everyone is learning at their own pace. Be encouraging, make room for mistakes, and support each other’s growth.
- Don’t be afraid to ask questions.

5. **Image**

- Unless a student notifies the instructors otherwise, any recordings of the class—such as photos, videos, or audio—may be used by Melodia to promote events and classes.
