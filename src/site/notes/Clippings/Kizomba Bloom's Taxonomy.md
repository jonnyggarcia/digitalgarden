Hi everyone,

It is important, however, to place this enthusiasm within the framework of Bloom’s Taxonomy, which is the foundation of this teaching training course. At this stage, all of you are in the Remembering stage. This first stage emphasizes repetition and muscle memory. The questions you are asking now often reflect the fact that your muscle memory has not yet fully internalized the fundamentals.

Through consistent repetition, your body not just your mind will begin to “remember.” Once this happens, you will naturally progress to the next stages, such as Analyzing and Evaluating, where your current questions will be answered through embodied understanding rather than theoretical speculation.

Trust the process: each stage builds upon the previous one, and mastery develops step by step.

Kizomba Bloom’s Taxonomy – A Teaching Framework

1. *Remembering – Building Muscle Memory*

At the first stage, the focus is repetition. In Kizomba, remembering is not just about the brain recalling steps it’s about training the body and muscles through repetition until movements become automatic. This is where we drill the fundamentals: basic steps, saída, retrocesso, balance, and connection. The goal is to store these patterns in muscle memory so the dancer can move without hesitation.

2. *Understanding – Knowing the Why Behind the Movements*

Once the fundamentals live in muscle memory, students progress to understanding. Here they learn why each fundamental exists and how it supports the dance’s flow, connection, and musicality. For example, why saída opens movement possibilities, or why weight transfer and pauses are essential. This stage develops not just execution, but awareness of purpose, setting the foundation for true dance evolution.

3. *Applying – Making the Dance Fluid*

After understanding the purpose, dancers begin to apply fundamentals in context. This means combining steps fluidly, respecting the music, and learning that not all fundamentals fit together smoothly. Application requires making choices that sustain connection and flow rather than just “stacking” moves. The dancer starts adapting what they know to different songs, tempos, and partners while keeping Kizomba’s essence.

4. *Analyzing – Dissecting Movement and Connection*

At this stage, dancers start looking deeper: breaking down what works and what doesn’t. Analyzing means observing details of body mechanics, timing, and partner response. For example, noticing why a saída feels heavy with one execution but light with another, or how chest vs. hip initiation changes fluidity. This is also where dancers compare variations and learn how fundamentals interact with music and partner, preparing them for refined choices.

5. *Evaluating – Making Conscious Decisions*

Once dancers can analyze movement, they begin evaluating. Here, they judge the quality of their dancing:

Is the movement authentic to Kizomba?

Does it preserve connection with the partner?

Does it respect the music and cultural essence?

This is where self-critique and reflection come in. Dancers test variations, discard what breaks fluidity, and keep what strengthens expression and connection. Evaluation is about discipline choosing the right tool at the right time.

6. *Creating – Freedom Without Losing the Essence*

The final stage is creativity. With solid fundamentals, awareness, application, and critical judgment, dancers can create their own interpretations variations, personal styling, improvisations without distorting the essence of Kizomba. Creativity here is not invention for its own sake, but a natural evolution born from deep respect for the roots, connection, and music. At this stage, the dancer becomes a true artist, expressing individuality within the cultural framework.

How It All Ties Together

Remembering gives you the tools.

Understanding explains why the tools exist.

Applying shows you how to use them.

Analyzing helps you see what works best.

Evaluating teaches you to make wise choices.

Creating allows you to express freely while respecting tradition.

This teaching system mirrors both the natural progression of learning and the evolution of mastery in Kizomba from repetition, to comprehension, to critical artistry.
