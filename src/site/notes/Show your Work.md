# Summary

The book Show your Work by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) advocate that everybody should display their work specially the process behind the scenes because in that way people can relate to the artist. When the artist share about them beyond what they make, it creates an opportunity to find people that correlate. Even a beginner artist without much "final product" to share, should be sharing their process, their learnings, influences and etc. It is about striking a meaningful conversation with an audience. Rather than marketing yourself, by create an online presence, within time people will find you.

# Connections

The majority of us are not genius that will sprang a new art movement, however we can be connected with people on the art scene that is relevant. The called it a Scenius. This an observation that my friend Maul and myself notice how the famous people in history were connected or part of groups with other relevant people. ==The questions is: how to find those relevant people and be with them?==

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“scenius.” Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.” — location: [53]() 

</div></div>


Another reason to be in the scene is because creative work does not happen in isolation. It is a mix of different influences. So we can be one of those influences by being online. Myself and Mauricio often get together to discuss about random topics, and usually that last for at least 4 hour!

You can’t be content with mastery; you have to push yourself to become a student again. “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton. — location: [794]()

The book discuss about being a professional vs and amateurs. One interesting point is that the amateur, one who do not live base on their work, has nothing to lose and are willing to try anything. I always had a similar though about become a professional artist; I do not want to be restrained by imposition of external forces.

Despite the amateurs my lack skills, those can be harnessed. The greatest challenged is about doing it and not about the product. The courage to make something will teach the a person the necessary skills. This bring me the memory of passage on the book [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] that mentioned about quantity makes things happen regardless of quality, where as perfection will never be achieved and therefore limit the actual art making. In the end it is about make, create, be "vocal".

# Ephemerality

There is a passage on the book to put perspective in the act of art making. It was about the ephemerality of life; we all can die at any moment. Having the mentality of do what you do as it is the last time you are doing it is the key to exist and be authentic. I tend to agree, however having a real life threatening experience is not the same as try to emulate the mentality. it is very easy to fall on the trap of caring about consequences. One way the author suggest about this is to read the obituaries a "near-death experiences for cowards" (that is funny!) That remind the practice to painting skull in the middle ages to remind people that no one is above death.

</div></div>


# Value

The value of art is a trick business. To the author it means a lot, but somebody else it is garbage. I have a theory that most people have no clue what means to be an artist, therefore they have zero reference to measure and attribute value to a piece of work. It seems the author agrees with me.

# Sharing

To counter weight that we can share the process and stop being scared to plagiarized. By doing it, we create in our audience the sense of value embed in the our work.

Now, i have to be honest. I love to see art made by everyone. I do spend hours looking at instagram. However, i must confess that I'm not that much interested in the process, mostly because I do not relate to them. Most people i follow on instagram are analog collage artist, and their process is complete different from mine, specially because my chosen media is digital. I do not have the same constrains as they have, and therefore the product they will make is shaped by that limitation. Although the authors point it is about how to communicate with our audience, which includes people who are not artist. So, I decided to do this by creating my Digital Garden, the current page you are reading. Let's see how that goes in one year.

The book strongly recommend to start documenting the artistic process. Inspired by it, i create my digital gardening and i am cataloging all my collages in different aspects. First i am applying hashtags to describe them, so i can easily find them. I will be going through my inventory and will explain what is the collage about specially because i notice that majority of things i made i do not recollect the reason why. I you are curious go check [[Digital Collage\|Digital Collage]]. Still work in progress though.

The sharing part can be anything, a new art piece, a reflection, something you saw that inspire you. It is about the process of sharing and not what to share. Of course it has to make some sort of sense and we should be aware that the information is public.

“Post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you.” — location: [253]()

One way of thing about what to share is by asking yourself:

**What I can share that can be useful to someone else?**

As a self-though artist, i strong relate to that. I am still thinking what i can share to contribute.

> 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The act of sharing is one of generosity—you’re putting something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen. — location: [255]()

# Practice

This week i will be starting [Collage in Practice Workshop](https://kolajmagazine.com/content/content/calls-for-artists/call-to-artists-collage-in-practice-workshop/) facilitated by [Kolaj Institute](https://kolajinstitute.org/) Part of the application require to answer questions that related to the details of my practice. I had to reflect upon them. At the book they mention something similar. The idea of sharing the in and outs of our work is like a personal museum with audio guide.

> 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share. — location: [363]() 

</div></div>


One of the reasons I make art is due to my difficulty to express emotion which is related to Alexithymia, that i will explain in another reflection. I also liked the cryptographic idea of art, most of the time people cannot really understand what the piece is about. By making art I felt relieved and at the same protected because people will not inquire about it. However, being courage to show the process behind, may triggers me somehow. That is something to be explored.

# Together and not against

How many people hold on to skill, techniques, knowledge in fear of losing something? Well I am thankful for those who are not afraid because I learned everything on the internet for free. The truth is sharing something is not the same knowing that thing. It takes time and dedication to master it. Sharing it is not equivalent the hours applied to it.

I always be a fan of that philosophy. My dance partners know about that. Despite my short period of dancing salsa, I am always willing to help them practice. In that way both of us get more millage, we become better friends, we evolve together. It is a win-win situation.

But pay attention of sincere critiques that may hurt your; those come from the people who care about you.

Again [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] tells us about that one of the best teachers you can have is your last work. It will inform you what needs to be worked on for the next piece. I think this apply for the criticisms as well.

# Survive

Yes we like art, but we also have to pay the bills. I hate marketing myself! I hate advertise myself. So in the book it suggest to add a link for people to give donation, like buy me a coffee #todo!

One strategy is to cultivate relationships and when you needed you have an army of people ready to help you. So back to sharing!

But don't forget, once you succeed help others.

It is important to understand that our art is also work even if we don't make living out of it. So it is important to separate it from the other parts of our live. We should not neglect them.

# Summary

The book "Show Your Work" by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) advocates that everyone should showcase their work, especially the process behind the scenes. This approach allows people to connect with the artist on a more personal level. When artists share insights beyond their finished products, it creates opportunities for meaningful connections. Even novice artists, who may not have many "final products" to share, should focus on sharing their processes, learnings, influences, etc. The goal is to initiate meaningful conversations with the audience. Rather than actively marketing oneself, creating an online presence over time will naturally attract interested individuals.

</div></div>


# Connections

While most of us may not be geniuses sparking new art movements, we can connect with relevant people in the art scene, forming what Kleon refers as "Scenius". My friend Maul, once commented how influential individuals were often connected or part of groups with other significant figures. The question then arises: *how do we find and engage with these relevant people?*

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

Another reason to be part of the scene is that creative work does not happen in isolation; it is a blend of various influences. By being present online, one can become one of those influences. Maul and I frequently engage in discussions about random topics, often lasting for at least four hours!

The book explores the dichotomy of being a professional versus an amateur. An interesting point raised is that amateurs, who do not rely on their work for a living, have nothing to lose and are willing to try anything. I've always held a similar perspective regarding becoming a professional artist – the desire to avoid constraints imposed by external forces.

Despite lacking skills, amateurs can harness their potential. The primary challenge is taking action, with the emphasis on the process rather than the final product. The courage to create something will teach necessary skills. This brings to mind a passage from the book "Art & Fear," stating that quantity leads to progress, irrespective of quality, while perfection is elusive and limits actual art-making. Ultimately, it's about making, creating, and being expressive.

# Ephemerality

A passage in the book puts the act of art-making into perspective, emphasizing the ephemerality of life, where anyone can die at any moment. Adopting the mindset of doing each task as if it were the last helps one exist authentically. While I agree with this perspective, experiencing a real-life threatening situation differs from attempting to emulate the same mentality. The author suggests reading obituaries as a form of "near-death experiences for cowards," (funny). It reminds me of the medieval practice of painting skulls to remind people of their mortality.

# Value

The value of art is subjective and varies widely. The author acknowledges this, highlighting that what holds significance for one person might be considered garbage by another. I share the theory that many people lack a clear understanding of what it means to be an artist, making it challenging for them to attribute value to a piece of work. The author seems to concur with this perspective.

Now, to be honest, while I enjoy viewing art created by others and spend hours on Instagram, I confess that I'm less interested in the process, mainly because I can't relate to it. Most of the people I follow are analog collage artists, and their process differs significantly from mine, especially since my chosen medium is digital. I lack the same constraints they face, shaping their products accordingly. Despite this, the author emphasizes the importance of communicating with a broader audience, including non-artists. Hence, I decided to create my Digital Garden, which you are currently exploring. Let's see how it evolves in a year.

I plan to delve into my inventory, explaining the reasons behind each collage, as I noticed that I often forget why I created certain pieces. If you're curious, you can check out [[Digital Collage\|Digital Collage]]. It's still a work in progress, though.

The sharing aspect can take various forms – a new art piece, a reflection, or something that inspired you. The key is the act of sharing, not necessarily the content. Of course, it should make sense, and one should be aware that the information is public.

As a self-taught artist, I strongly resonate with this question. I am still contemplating what I can share to contribute.

I've always disliked marketing or promoting my ideas, despite having many. However, our friend Austin made an interesting point:

# Practice

This week, I am starting the [Collage in Practice Workshop](https://kolajmagazine.com/content/content/calls-for-artists/call-to-artists-collage-in-practice-workshop/) facilitated by [Kolaj Institute](https://kolajinstitute.org/). The application process required reflection on various aspects of my practice. The book touches on a similar idea – the concept of sharing the ins and outs of our work is akin to a personal museum with an audio guide.

Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share. — location: [363]()

One of the reasons I create art is due to my difficulty expressing emotions, which is related to Alexithymia (to be explained in another reflection). I am also drawn to the cryptographic nature of art – often, people cannot fully understand the meaning behind a piece. Making art offers me relief and safe because people usually don't inquire about it. However, having the courage to reveal the process might trigger something new, and that's something worth exploring.

Strike all the adjectives from your bio. If you take photos, you’re not an “aspiring” photographer, and you’re not an “amazing” photographer, either. You’re a photographer. Don’t get cute. Don’t brag. Just state the facts. — location: [463]()

# Together, Not Against

How many people cling to skills, techniques, and knowledge out of fear of losing something? I am thankful for those who are not afraid because I learned everything on the internet for free. The truth is, sharing something is not the same as knowing that thing. It takes time and dedication to master it. Sharing is not equivalent to the hours invested.

I have always been a fan of that philosophy. My dance partners know this about me. Despite my brief period of dancing salsa, I am always willing to help them practice. This way, both of us gain more experience, become better friends, and evolve together. It's a win-win situation.

# Do Not Be a Span

Spans are those individuals who are self-centered, believing nothing else matters. I believe the analogy is akin to the spam emails that inundate us, focusing solely on their interests.

I've learned that art means different things to different people. People don't really care about what you make unless they already care about you. The trolls on the internet are not important. So, keep the good people around, but never underestimate the power of rejection. People will criticize you and your work – move on. However, pay attention to sincere critiques that may hurt, as they come from people who care about you.

Once again, [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] tells us that one of the best teachers is our last work. It informs us about what needs improvement for the next piece. I think this applies to criticisms as well.

Yes, this section requires many quotes to inspire us to keep going!

# Survive

Yes, we love art, but we also have to pay the bills. I hate marketing myself! I hate advertising myself. So, the book suggests adding a link for people to give donations, like a "buy me a coffee" link #todo!

One strategy is to cultivate relationships so that when you need help, you have an army of people ready to assist you. So, back to sharing!

But don't forget, once you succeed, help others.

When you have success, it’s important to use any dough, clout, or platform you’ve acquired to help along the work of the people who’ve helped you get to where you are. — location: [715]()

# Personal Life

It is important to understand that our art is also work, even if we don't make a living from it. Therefore, it is crucial to separate it from other parts of our lives. We should not neglect them.

Inspiration is all around, but the book talks about taking time off and allowing that time to recharge us, preparing us for what comes next.

# Homework

The book asks us to:

- Share your stuff online (done!!!)
- Plan a "Show Your Work!" night (to be done #todo)
- Give a copy of the book (sharing this as a way to allow people to come across it)
