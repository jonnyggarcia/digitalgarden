# Summary

The book Show your Work by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) advocate that everybody should display their work specially the process behind the scenes because in that way people can relate to the artist. When the artist share about them beyond what they make, it creates an opportunity to find people that correlate. Even a beginner artist without much "final product" to share, should be sharing their process, their learnings, influences and etc. It is about striking a meaningful conversation with an audience. Rather than marketing yourself, by create an online presence, within time people will find you.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage. — location: 30

# Connections

The majority of us are not genius that will sprang a new art movement, however we can be connected with people on the art scene that is relevant. The called it a Scenius. This an observation that my friend Maul and myself notice how the famous people in history were connected or part of groups with other relevant people. ==The questions is: how to find those relevant people and be with them?==


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“scenius.” Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.” — location: 53 

</div></div>


Another reason to be in the scene is because creative work does not happen in isolation. It is a mix of different influences. So we can be one of those influences by being online. Myself and Mauricio often get together to discuss about random topics, and usually that last for at least 4 hour!


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



good work isn’t created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds. — location: 57

You can’t be content with mastery; you have to push yourself to become a student again. “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton. — location: 794 

</div></div>


The book discuss about being a professional vs amateur. One interesting point is that the amateur, one who do not live base on their work, has nothing to lose and are willing to try anything. I always had a similar though about become a professional artist; I do not want to be restrained by imposition of external forces.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act,” writes Clay Shirky in his book Cognitive Surplus. — location: 78 

</div></div>


Despite the amateurs my lack skills, those can be harnessed. The greatest challenged is about doing it and not about the product. The courage to make something will teach the a person the necessary skills. This bring me the memory of passage on the book [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] that mentioned about quantity makes things happen regardless of quality, where as perfection will never be achieved and therefore limit the actual art making. In the end it is about make, create, be "vocal".

So don’t think of it as starting over. Think of it as beginning again. — location: 806 

</div></div>


# Ephemerality

There is a passage on the book to put perspective in the act of art making. It was about the ephemerality of life; we all can die at any moment. Having the mentality of do what you do as it is the last time you are doing it is the key to exist and be authentic. I tend to agree, however having a real life threatening experience is not the same as try to emulate the mentality. it is very easy to fall on the trap of caring about consequences. One way the author suggest about this is to read the obituaries a "near-death experiences for cowards" (that is funny!) That remind the practice to painting skull in the middle ages to remind people that no one is above death.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. — location: 124

if you could walk around like that all the time, to really have that awareness that it’s actually going to end. That’s the trick.” — location: 137 

</div></div>


# Value

The value of art is a trick business. To the author it means a lot, but somebody else it is garbage. I have a theory that most people have no clue what means to be an artist, therefore they have zero reference to measure and attribute value to a piece of work. It seems the author agrees with me.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

The quote above reminds me so much about [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]]. I need to read that book again and make notes! # todo!!!

# Sharing

To counter weight that we can share the process and stop being scared to plagiarized. By doing it, we create in our audience the sense of value embed in the our work.

Now, i have to be honest. I love to see art made by everyone. I do spend hours looking at instagram. However, i must confess that I'm not that much interested in the process, mostly because I do not relate to them. Most people i follow on instagram are analog collage artist, and their process is complete different from mine, specially because my chosen media is digital. I do not have the same constrains as they have, and therefore the product they will make is shaped by that limitation. Although the authors point it is about how to communicate with our audience, which includes people who are not artist. So, I decided to do this by creating my Digital Garden, the current page you are reading. Let's see how that goes in one year.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products.” — location: 173

I used to talk to this analog artist that at certain point start to explain their collages on their instagram posts. Accord to them, they start to get more likes.

</div></div>


The book strongly recommend to start documenting the artistic process. Inspired by it, i create my digital gardening and i am cataloging all my collages in different aspects. First i am applying hashtags to describe them, so i can easily find them. I will be going through my inventory and will explain what is the collage about specially because i notice that majority of things i made i do not recollect the reason why. I you are curious go check [[Digital Collagetec\|Digital Collagetec]]. Still work in progress though.

The sharing part can be anything, a new art piece, a reflection, something you saw that inspire you. It is about the process of sharing and not what to share. Of course it has to make some sort of sense and we should be aware that the information is public.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“Post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you.” — location: 253 

</div></div>


One way of thing about what to share is by asking yourself:

**What I can share that can be useful to someone else?**

As a self-though artist, i strong relate to that. I am still thinking what i can share to contribute.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The act of sharing is one of generosity—you’re putting something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen. — location: 255

I always hate marketing or advocating about my ideas, despite having lots of them. But our fiend Austin just said something very interesting:

# Practice

This week i will be starting [Collage in Practice Workshop](https://kolajmagazine.com/content/content/calls-for-artists/call-to-artists-collage-in-practice-workshop/) facilitated by [Kolaj Institute](https://kolajinstitute.org/) Part of the application require to answer questions that related to the details of my practice. I had to reflect upon them. At the book they mention something similar. The idea of sharing the in and outs of our work is like a personal museum with audio guide.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Attribution is all about providing context for what you’re sharing: what the work is, who made it, how they made it, when and where it was made, why you’re sharing it, why people should care about it, and where people can see some more work like it. Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share. — location: 363 

</div></div>


One of the reasons I make art is due to my difficulty to express emotion which is related to Alexithymia, that i will explain in another reflection. I also liked the cryptographic idea of art, most of the time people cannot really understand what the piece is about. By making art I felt relieved and at the same protected because people will not inquire about it. However, being courage to show the process behind, may triggers me somehow. That is something to be explored.

# Be an artist


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Strike all the adjectives from your bio. If you take photos, you’re not an “aspiring” photographer, and you’re not an “amazing” photographer, either. You’re a photographer. Don’t get cute. Don’t brag. Just state the facts. — location: 463 

</div></div>


# Together and not against

How many people hold on to skill, techniques, knowledge in fear of losing something? Well I am thankful for those who are not afraid because I learned everything on the internet for free. The truth is sharing something is not the same knowing that thing. It takes time and dedication to master it. Sharing it is not equivalent the hours applied to it.

I always be a fan of that philosophy. My dance partners know about that. Despite my short period of dancing salsa, I am always willing to help them practice. In that way both of us get more millage, we become better friends, we evolve together. It is a win-win situation.

I learned that art mens shit to other people. People don't really care about what you make, unless they already care about you. The troll on the internet it is not really important. So keep the good people around, but never underestimate the power of the rejection. People will say shit about you and your work; move on. But pay attention of sincere critiques that may hurt your; those come from the people who care about you.

Again [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] tells us about that one of the best teachers you can have is your last work. It will inform you what needs to be worked on for the next piece. I think this apply for the criticisms as well.

Yes, this section requires lots of quotes to inspire to us to keep going!

# Survive

Yes we like art, but we also have to pay the bills. I hate marketing myself! I hate advertise myself. So in the book it suggest to add a link for people to give donation, like buy me a coffee # todo!

One strategy is to cultivate relationships and when you needed you have an army of people ready to help you. So back to sharing!

But don't forget, once you succeed help others.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



When you have success, it’s important to use any dough, clout, or platform you’ve acquired to help along the work of the people who’ve helped you get to where you are. — location: 715 

</div></div>


# Personal Life

It is important to understand that our art is also work even if we don't make living out of it. So it is important to separate it from the other parts of our live. We should not neglect them.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



It’s very important to separate your work from the rest of your life. As my wife said to me, “If you never go to work, you never get to leave work.” — location: 788 

</div></div>


Inspiration is all around, but the book talks about taking time off and allow that time to recharge us and be ready for what is next.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“Everything that we designed in the seven years following the first sabbatical had its roots in thinking done during that sabbatical.” — location: 772 

</div></div>


# Homework

The book ask us to:

- Share your stuff online (done!!!)
- Plan a "Show Your Work!" night. (to be done # todo )
- Give a copy the book. (Sharing this as way to allow people to come across it)
