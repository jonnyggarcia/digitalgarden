Developing language to talk about our art practice is critical to achieving our creative and professional goals.

Let's brainstorm together in this [Googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzmD0JjSSzxXB1yMVUhPFM-HU1vlIVwm6t4zgz9GWcU/edit?usp=sharing). Post a word. Define a word. Use the channel module-discussionÂ channel to ask for clarification of a word. If you could pick one word or phrase that describes your artwork, what would it be?

**MODULE: Collage Taxonomy**

# Digital Collage

Digital collage is the process of assembling digital ephemera through software producing a digital file as the final product. Throughout this process, the ephemera can be altered in any conceivable way, including changes in dimension, proportion, and color.

# Hand-made Collage

Hand-made collage is the process of assembling non-digital ephemera to produce a final product on a substrate where the binding of the elements is done by hand. The binding can be achieved through various methods such as glue or threads. This process excludes techniques like digital collage, photomontage, Scanography, among others.

# Assemblage

Assemblage is the process to combine objects together producing a new tridimensional object(s).
