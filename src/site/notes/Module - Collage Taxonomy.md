Developing language to talk about our art practice is critical to achieving our creative and professional goals.

Let's brainstorm together in this [Googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzmD0JjSSzxXB1yMVUhPFM-HU1vlIVwm6t4zgz9GWcU/edit?usp=sharing) (see it below). Post a word. Define a word. Use the channel module-discussion channel to ask for clarification of a word. If you could pick one word or phrase that describes your artwork, what would it be?

# MODULE: Collage Taxonomy

## Digital Collage

Digital collage is the process of assembling digital ephemera through software producing a digital file as the final product. Throughout this process, the ephemera can be altered in any conceivable way, including changes in dimension, proportion, and color.

## Hand-made Collage

Hand-made collage is the process of assembling non-digital ephemera to produce a final product on a substrate where the binding of the elements is done by hand. The binding can be achieved through various methods such as glue or threads. This process excludes techniques like digital collage, photomontage, Scanography, among others.

## Assemblage

Assemblage is the process to combine objects together producing a new tridimensional object(s).

# Collage Taxonomy

Collage has a problem with taxonomy. Because collage is both a medium and a genre, an approach to artmaking that involves lots of different media, its definition is vague.

## Taxonomy: the Classification of Something

At Kolaj Magazine, we approach collage broadly and, as such, we have included in our territory of inquiry such media as traditional cut-and-paste collage, digital collage, assemblage, photomontage, fibre art when it has an element of juxtaposition, and painting when it appears as if multiple visual languages are in use or cut paper fragments are used as a compositional tool of the painter in a manner that is evident in the final work.

## Appellation: the Act of Giving a name to a Thing

While this approach is fun and has broadened our understanding to include both the genre of collage, the method, and the medium, it becomes problematic when we engage in critical and curatorial matters.

Collage is an enormous tree and its branches are as widespread and diverse as its roots. If we are truly going to celebrate all things collage (and more importantly, advance a critical and curatorial understanding of collage), we need to develop a collage taxonomy.

## Definition: State or Describe Exactly the Nature, Scope, or Meaning of

Here’s where you come in:

Visit [kolajmagazine.com/taxonomy/](http://www.kolajmagazine.com/taxonomy.html). There you will find a simple form where you can suggest words and their meanings. They can be your own private understanding or a recommendation for defining a term or phrase. The purpose is not to divide this wonderfully broad community of collage, but rather to give us a language to talk about it.

# ADD YOUR WORDS HERE

## Analogue Collage

Analogue collage uses actual materials, such as paper and found images or objects, to create artwork and is considered the traditional method to make a collage.  The collage materials are often physically attached together to create the final product.  The use of a variety of materials in analogue collage can provide a tactile quality to the artwork.

## Assemblage

Assemblage is the process to combine objects together producing a new tridimensional object(s).

## Collage Illustration

Illustration is a visual representation or interpretation of a concept, idea, narrative, or text. It involves creating images, often for the purpose of accompanying written content, to enhance or clarify the meaning of the text. Illustrations can take various forms, including drawings, paintings, prints, digital images, also collages.
Illustration plays a crucial role in visual communication, allowing for the conveyance of complex ideas in a more accessible and engaging manner. 

## Cut

Cutting is the act of making an opening or incision in a piece of material, often towards the end of removing a piece of visual material from its original context, whether digital or analog. Cutting might be achieved with scissors, blades, or digital tools. The act of “tearing” might be considered a type of cutting in the broader vocabulary of collage (e.g. the phrase “cutting and pasting” does not necessarily imply that objects were cut rather than torn). 

## Cut and Paste

The act by which an image, text or element is excised from the original of a physical or digital document  by either analogue or digital means and moved  to another page.

## Dadaesque 1

Used to describe works that are whimsical, irrational, spontaneous, impulsive, norm-challenging, or otherwise inspired by or someway connected to the Dadaist movement

## Dadaesque 2

An adjective reminiscent of Dada - a revolutionary art movement commencing in response to World War 1.

Ranging from the carnivalesque to the nonsensical to the grotesque, art that is dadaesque can be seen as art that is evocative of a total demolition of the traditional culture by inverting the norms of decency. Dadaesque describes art that encompasses intellectual play, revolution, reaction, fragmentation, mimicry and nonsense in order to shock the prevailing order.

## Digital Collage

Digital collage is the process of assembling digital ephemera through software producing a digital file as the final product. Throughout this process, the ephemera can be altered in any conceivable way, including changes in dimension, proportion, and color.

## Fair Use

Fair Use-fair any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.

## Genre

Genre is any form or type of communication in any mode with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time.

There is also subgenre and microgenre.

Collage in and of itself is a genre which has the potential to be further defined having regard to elements/materials and processes, eg analogue, digital, paper, fabric, photomontage. The story or narrative may also lead to a classification.

## Hand-made Collage

Hand-made collage is the process of assembling non-digital ephemera to produce a final product on a substrate where the binding of the elements is done by hand. The binding can be achieved through various methods such as glue or threads. This process excludes techniques like digital collage, photomontage, Scanography, among others.

## Juxtaposition 1

Juxtaposition—the placement or arrangement of two or more things (such as ideas, images, or elements) side by side for the purpose of highlighting their contrasting features or creating a meaningful connection.

## Juxtaposition 2

An intentional choice of presenting at least two concepts or visual cues that take on more meaning by nature of being considered or shown together. Their proximity can highlight a difference or bolster a similarity, either conceptually or compositionally. 

## Mixed Media

Mixed Media is a term used to describe artworks composed from a combination of different media or materials.

## Pop Art

Art based on modern popular culture and the mass media, especially as a critical or [ironic](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=598570873&rls=en&biw=1440&bih=746&sxsrf=ACQVn08RTl6_BMmaQlxoI4E8zASxRmQnBg:1705324675431&q=ironic&si=AKbGX_qTCvK6ifvkUBYDz4foaFZiQM2xwudoW4fcP_m5mg1p4qRmLK_wDcRkrpN9XVPXhbEVpVzk-JiaqspU2hhWiI2PiZIqsw%3D%3D&expnd=1) comment on traditional fine art values 

## Process Collage

(Proposed appellation)

(From Tate Modern Art Terms:  The term process art refers to where the process of its making art is not hidden but remains a prominent aspect of the completed work, so that a part or even the whole of its subject is the making of the work.)

Process collage - an analogue collage in which the process of making the collage is essential to the image and expression of the work.  Process collage can be made of multiple added layers or subtracted layers or a combination of both. Layers can be cut or torn, glued or otherwise attached, and can be created out of any material. However it is assembled, the work is up front about process. The artist shows you how it is made, but revealing the process doesn’t kill the mystery. Instead it adds to the expression and becomes essential to it. Process collage may often have the appearance and presence of sculpture due to the accumulation of material used to create it. Examples of process collage would include work by Andrea Burgay, Nata Drachinskaya, Mark Bradford,  Noriko Ambe, Howardina Pindell, Samuel Levi Jones, Shabez Jamal, Jemima Wyman, El Anatsui, and John Chamberlain.

## Surrealism

The practice of producing fantastic or incongruous imagery or effects in art, literature, film, or theater by means of unnatural or irrational juxtapositions and combinations.

There are many definitions on line:

- A style in art and literature in which ideas, images, and objects are combined in a strange way, like in a dream

- A twentieth-century literary, philosophical and artistic movement that explored the workings of the mind, championing the irrational, the poetic and the revolutionary   (Tate)

- Surrealism was a means of reuniting conscious and [unconscious](https://www.britannica.com/science/unconscious) realms of experience so completely that the world of [dream](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dream-sleep-experience) and [fantasy](https://www.britannica.com/art/fantasy-narrative-genre) would be joined to the everyday rational world in “an absolute reality, a surreality -   Andre Breton

## Wabi Sabi

Taken from the Japanese words wabi, which translates to less is more, and sabi, which means attentive melancholy, wabi-sabi refers to an awareness of the transient nature of earthly things and a corresponding pleasure in the things that bear the mark of this impermanence.s
