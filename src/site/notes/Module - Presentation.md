# PRESENTATION

In our final meeting, you are invited to make a short 3-5 minute presentation of your artist practice. Presentations will be timed. The presentation of images will be centralized. During the zoom, when it is your turn to present, your name will appear on the screen. The clock will start when you say "Next Slide." As you present, say next slide to advance to the next image. After the presentation, we will have time for feedback from the group.Here's how to go about preparing your presentation:

## Step 1

Identify six images that represent different areas of your practice:

- Play & Research

These images may be artwork or photographs.

## Step 2

Identify 1-2 ideas that explain each of the different areas of your practice. Write a sentence or two about each.

- **Play & Research**
	- Unsplash, royalty free images
	- Personal selfies
	- Pictures of people I know
- **Process**
	- Self-imposed project with constrains to create commonality.
	- Due to Alexithymia, also known as emotional blindness, I have difficult to verbally express my feelings and collage to create a visual representation of them.
	- The digital freedom to change the elements as I wish is fundamental to express what I have hard time to express verbally.
	- Songs, melodies on loop help create a mental state that facilitates the art-making process.
- **Making**
	- The collages are made on iPad with Apple Pencil, and the Procreate app.
	- I distill the elements to only what is essential for conveying meaning
	- Common elements are bodies, hands, faces, and abstract forms.
	- Elimination of the contrast when juxtaposing images. Creating a single entity.
	- Colour is intentionally applied using a limited and harmonious palette.
- **Finishing**
	- I maintain a well-organized inventory of all my artworks.
	- I have name patterns for collages associated with projects.
	- I can easily search and identify patterns through the use of a cataloging system.
	- When collages are printed, they have vital information on the back.
	- The destination determines how they will be printed and framed.
- **Diffusion**
	- Participating in open call, instagram, and personal website.
	- This year will be engaged in a collaborative project with 2 other artist to produce a proposal for galleries and curators.
- **Impact & Engagement**
	- My collages can be emotionally charged. Communicating with neuro divergent minds.
	- They also reflects the experiences of being an immigrant.

## Step 3

Practice your presentation. Remember to start the presentation by telling us who you are. End the presentation with a goal for your Artist Practice, where you want to take it next.

## Step 4

Submit your presentation: If you want to present, email six images to chris@kasinihouse.com before Midnight EST on Wednesday, 24 January. Label the images "1-YOUR NAME". The subject of the email should be "Collage in Practice: YOUR NAME". If you choose not to present, send Chris Byrne a message in Slack to let him know.
