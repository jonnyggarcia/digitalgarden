**Linha** (line) is a movement performed in a parallel position where the follower alternates direction—walking forward, then backward—every three steps. This is similar to a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]] but the couple move only in one direction.

**Lead**
1. Open 90 degrees like in [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]].
2. Step forward with the right foot, ensuring that the right hand, resting on the follower’s back, indicates forward momentum.
3. Step forward with the left foot while signalling the follower to execute a 180-degree pivot turn to the left. At the end of this step, the lead’s right hand should rest on the follower’s side, maintaining forward momentum. This is the same as the first step in [[Kiz - Man Saída\|Man Saída]].
4. Repeat from step 2. The pivot turn in step 3 will alternate between left and right.

**Follower**
1. The lead will signal to open a 90-degree, as in [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]], with the follower’s weight on the right side.
2. Take a left step forward, guided by the intention felt through the lead’s hand on the back.
3. Take a right step forward, while the lead indicates a pivot turn to the left.
4. Step backward with the left foot.
5. Take a right step backward, while the lead indicates a pivot turn to the right.
6. Repeat from step 2.

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead should maintain forward momentum.
- The lead must clearly signal the pivoting motion, alternating between left and right.
- When the follower completes the pivot turn, it counts as the first step of the Basic 3.
- Another way to count the steps is to use just 2 counts, with the follower always turning on count 1.
