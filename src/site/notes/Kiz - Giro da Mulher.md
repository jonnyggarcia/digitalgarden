**Giro da Mulher** (full spin for the lady) is a left turn for the follower. It is very similar to the [[Kiz - Meio Giro\|Meio Giro]] but with an additional rotation.

**Lead**
1. The lead performs a [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]] but keeps the right hand on the side of the follower’s body. The right hand is intended to stop the follower from stepping back with the left foot. Using the same hand, gently pull the follower forward, keeping the hand on the follower’s body throughout the movement. This is called **tracing**, which helps the follower stay aware of the lead’s position. Be respectful of your touch.
2. Take a right step across to the left. Raise the left hand to the follower’s eye level, with the palm facing down. This hand will guide the follower during the turn. Be conscious of any adjustments the follower makes regarding the height of the hand.
3. Take a small left step forward while providing spinning rotation to the left across the follower’s back with your right hand.
4. Perform a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the right.

**Follower**
1. Take a right step back, as in [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]]. However, the lead’s right hand will be on the follower’s side to prevent them from taking a second step back (with the left leg). This hand will provide momentum forward. Throughout the entire turn, this hand will indicate where the lead is.
2. Pivot on the left foot to the left and transfer the weight. The lead will raise the follower’s right hand up, keeping the palm facing up. The lead’s hand will guide the direction of the turn. Perform any necessary adjustments to the height of the hand.
3. Complete a full turn by taking a right step while turning to face the lead. Turn the foot as much as you can, pointing toward the lead. Compared to Step 3 of [[Kiz - Meio Giro\|Meio Giro]], the spinning momentum is greater, causing the follower to complete the turn.
4. 4. Perform a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the left. Pay attention to the lead’s hand on your back, as it will indicate when to reconnect.
