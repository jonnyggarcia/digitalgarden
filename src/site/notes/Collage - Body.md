**Context:** The three images compose some sort of sculpture that is on display for contemplation. This collage represents my connection with observation and contemplation. The black and white tone brings the idea of something old or unreachable. Ultimately this is about my unrealistic ideas about body and the sexual act. This collage was inspired by the practice of Contact Improvisation dance form. This collage is also part of the series B&W and Body.
