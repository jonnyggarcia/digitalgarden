**Balance (Balanced Scale)** is a rocking step. It can be performed on the spot, without moving the legs, by only transferring the weight. It can also be performed with one step forward, followed by a balance, then a step backward, another balance, and so on.

This move can be executed in both close and open positions. The open position will be discussed in [[Kiz - Woman Saída\|Women Saída]].

The execution of this move allows for a change in direction without a marca, or it can be used to emphasize the music.

The lead must use the connection points to indicate a stop in the motion so the follower doesn’t continue walking.

**Balance on the Spot**

- The lead walks forward with the left leg. Follower steps back with the right leg.
- Before moving the right leg, the lead should gently prevent the follower from taking another step by pulling the follower towards them. That will should shift the weight back to their left leg.
- Without moving the legs, the lead uses the chest to indicate to the follower to transfer their weight to the back leg.
