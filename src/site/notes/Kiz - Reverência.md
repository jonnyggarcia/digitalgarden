ReverÃªncia (Salute) is a mirrored move where the lead and the follower move back and collect the leg (marca) and then move forward using the same leg.

The lead indicates the movement to the follower with a gentle push with the left hand and disconnection the right arm. After the marca, the lead should gently pull the lead in and reconnect. The movement can be done several time.

*Variation*

When moving toward the partner, you can turn 180 degrees giving your back to your partner. Then reverse as you open.
