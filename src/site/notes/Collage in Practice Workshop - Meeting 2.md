The term "mixed media" fails to specify the materials used in creating the artwork.

It is always a good practice to document the source materials of an art piece. This information is extremely beneficial for writers and curators. Additionally, documenting the tools used, such as the type of glue or finish, provides insights into how to maintain the work in the future.

Any documentation is useful on many levels.

# Definition of Collage

Where do we draw the line on what is a collage?

- Everything can be a collage.
- Ric, as an editor and curator, wants to be open to the possibilities. What is interesting is how this is a collage?
- How do we think about collage?
- In which context do we define collage?
- The process to bind the elements is the "glue," regardless of how that comes to happen.

## [Tate](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/collage#:~:text=Collage%20describes%20both%20the%20technique,down%20onto%20a%20supporting%20surface)

> [!quote] Collage describes both the technique and the resulting work of art in which pieces of paper, photographs, fabric and other ephemera are arranged and stuck down onto a supporting surface

## [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/collage#:~:text=Derived%20from%20the%20French%20verb,affixed%20to%20a%20supporting%20surface.)

> [!quote] Derived from the French verb coller, meaning “to glue,” collage refers to both the technique and the resulting work of art in which fragments of paper and other materials are arranged and glued or otherwise affixed to a supporting surface.

## [My Modern Met](https://mymodernmet.com/collage-art/)

> [!quote]
> Coined by cubist artists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, the term “collage” comes from the French word *coller*, or “to glue.” The movement itself emerged under this pair of artists, who began working with various mediums to create avant-garde assemblages around 1910.
>
> Collages can be created from a range of materials, though most are made of paper or wood and often feature cut-and-pasted photographs, painted forms, or even 3-dimensional objects. As more and more modern artists began exploring the practice throughout the 20th century, these mediums became more varied and increasingly experimental.

> [!quote] History is mythology - Ric

## [National Galleries Scotland](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/glossary-terms/collage)

> [!quote] An image constructed from found materials, such as photographs, paper or fabric, glued to a surface, sometimes with additional painted or drawn elements. It is an art form particularly associated with Dada and Surrealism.

- There are other art movements related to collage.

## [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collage)

> [!quote] (the art of making) a picture in which various materials or objects, for example paper, cloth, or photographs, are stuck onto a larger surface:
>
> - The children made a collage of postcards.

- Infantilize because children also paint and draw.

## [Study.com](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-collage-definition-famous-artists-examples.html#:~:text=Collage%2C%20from%20the%20French%20verb,materials%20to%20a%20flat%20surface)

> [!quote] The word **collage** comes from the French word "coller" which means to stick together or to glue. The technique of making a picture collage is to take various colors, images, textures and even text from separate pieces and then merge them together to form an interesting new image. Because of a variety of bold angles, unusual shapes and mismatched colors, a collage can end up visually striking and profound in meaning, even if created from simple or basic materials.

- Referencing child practice, which is not the same as that of a professional artist.

# Collage as Medium X Genre

**Medium**

- Refers to the art materials or artist supplies used to create a work of art, (material)

**Genre**

- Refers to the type or category of the art or the content of the art (idea)

[Benon Lutaaya](https://kolajmagazine.com/artistdirectory/benon-lutaaya) painted with paper due lack of funds for paint. Medium is collage but the genre is painting.

- **What is our medium?**
- **What is our genre?**

# An Approach to Collage

How to approach collage in this workshop?

![Screen Shot 2024-01-11 at 16.46.07.png|400](/img/user/MEDIA/Screen%20Shot%202024-01-11%20at%2016.46.07.png)

- Some sort of material
- Some sort of glue
- Some sort surface

![Screen Shot 2024-01-11 at 16.58.51.png|400](/img/user/MEDIA/Screen%20Shot%202024-01-11%20at%2016.58.51.png)

- Material: Materials used.
- Juxtaposition: Conversation between the elements.
- Composition: The arrangement of the elements.

The artistic process of each artist is fascinating, and artists tend to be afraid to share it. We should be proud of it and share the ins and outs.

It is important to practice the language/vocabulary/taxonomy to tell a story that captures the attention of someone, be it writers, curators, or the audience.

Ric demonstrated his work where he used the concept of fragmentation in many different ways using only one picture of a wounded soldier. "How life takes us apart and puts us back together."

# Taxonomy

**What words can be used to describe the following?**

```
- [Gallery website](https://www.petzel.com/artists/john-stezaker)
- 2-bit collage.
- Minimal collage.
- Stills from films.
- Photo Montage: Ric disagrees because photo montage is done by manipulating different photographic negatives and making a print of it. The process is closely related to darkroom photography.
- Montage: Involves time and motion. Manipulation of time.

- Explosion, energy, direction. However, those words can mean something different to other people; they might describe it as busy.
- Collection of cars, women.
- Still, no perfect word to describe this kind of work.

- Just a photography using juxtaposition. Not a collage.

Ric's work of deconstructing Picasso is valid under a context because it cannot be recognized when mixed with other non-related pieces.

The exercise of examining the collage ancestors is a practice to observe how the work is being described.

# Ecosystem

How does art find its way into the world? How it is shown tells something about the art itself.

Find people who are more successful than you at diffusing and study their strategies.

What needs to be done to fit a particular ecosystem?

## White Cube Model

![ecosystem - white cube.png|500](/img/user/MEDIA/ecosystem%20-%20white%20cube.png)

- Creation of New York post 2nd World War.
- Related to the city and its economy, marked by an abundance of empty rectangular industrial spaces.
- Luxury, expansive, and expensive.
- No touching; it is not for you.

## Retail Market Model

![ecosystem - retail market.png|500](/img/user/MEDIA/ecosystem%20-%20retail%20market.png)

- Usually, collage is shown like that.
- Before the white cube model, that was a common way to display art.
- It is accessible.
- Able to touch.

Many people don't associate with art because they don't feel it is for them.

## Museums

![Galeries Dalmau 1912 exhibition, Barcelona, Spain.png|500](/img/user/MEDIA/Galeries%20Dalmau%201912%20exhibition,%20Barcelona,%20Spain.png)

```

```
- Museums used to be a place for artists, resources for them.
- They used to apply the retail market model but moved to the white cube model.
- Due to a lack of funds and efforts to attract more people to the museum, nowadays, they can be used for weddings or events.

## Spectacle

## Galleries

- Galleries cannot sell installations.
- They need to know you; it is a long-term relationship.
- Have you been there before?
- Do you know the gallery?
- What is the venue about?

## Books

- Books can be sent and shared; they are permanent.
- Illustrations as a form of commission.
	- The New York Times uses them often.

## Social Media

- Social Media favours motion over still images.

## Business

- Selling your art is like any other business, and it requires a business plan.
- A website where you could explore selling art <https://www.saatchiart.com>

## Other Factors

 - Tourism.
  - Provides an Instagram opportunity.
  - Fills the wall space.
- Who does the institution serve?
- Who is the audience?
- People who have lots of material on the market tend to be talked about more.
- Art is a market, so people want to sustain the value of their collections.
- Experiencing art without art in the room.
	- Immersive Van Gogh.
- What do you compete with?
- What do you bring to the table?

## Collage Art

- Usually small.
- How to fill the wall?
	- Make lots of them.
	- Scale it.
	- Project it: [Mark Murphy](https://www.markmurph.co.uk/)
- How to transform your practice to suit the space?
- What other elements can be added to complement it?
	- Adding a dinner table.

# Series

What constitutes a series? How do we contextualize a series?

- Think about it as a project.
- Creating multiple works that are correlated.
- Filling a small room in a gallery.
- Where might the work go?
- What art ecosystem are they intended for?

# Take away

As you think about your practice, what are your goals, and where do you want to be? What are the steps to get there?

These questions (the diffusion) are relevant during the making process.

Observe the ecosystem and figure out what needs to be done to communicate effectively with it.

- Do they use frames?
- What are the sizes?
- What kind of art is displayed?
- What kind of materials are used?
