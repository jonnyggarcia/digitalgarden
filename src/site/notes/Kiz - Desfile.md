**Desfile** (parade or fashion show) is the follower’s turn to the right, which requires a flick of the follower’s left arm.

**Leads**
1. Perform a 90-degree open, similar to [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. At the same time, use your right hand in a quick upward motion to toss the follower’s left arm up. Then, raise your left arm high enough for the follower to pass underneath it.
2. Mark a right step in place while using your right hand to turn the follower to the right. They will end up facing the same direction as you.
3. Mark a left step in place while giving a gentle pull with your left hand to signal the follower to come back.
4. Perform a Basic 2 to the right.

**Followers**
1. The lead will signal you to open 90 degrees, similar to [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. Your weight should be on your right leg. The lead will perform a flick, causing your left arm to move up. Follow the momentum and bring your arm forward, positioning it between you and the lead.
2. Take a left step forward, passing through the lead’s arm while executing a 90-degree turn to the right. At this moment, you will be facing the same direction as the lead.
3. The lead will signal you to come back with a gentle pull of their right hand. Perform a 90-degree turn to the right while taking a right step forward toward the lead.
4. Perform a Basic 2 to the left.

*Key elements of the move*
- Followers need to walk through the turn instead of spinning on the axis.
- Leads must be clear with the flick to ensure the follower’s left hand doesn’t interfere with the turn.
- Leads should mark the tempo in place.
