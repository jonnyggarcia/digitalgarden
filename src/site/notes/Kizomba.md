The [[Kiz - Curriculum\|Curriculum]] is divided into modules, each containing 5 classes.

Every step presented in the [[Kiz - Curriculum\|Curriculum]] has a Portuguese name. Aside from the basic steps, all the names presented were coined by me to aid in memorization and to create distinctions among them. I have also divided all the moves into six broad categories. In the [[Kiz - Movement Dictionary\|Movement Dictionary]], you can find all moves categorized.

Each step has its own page with various pieces of information:

- English name
- Demonstration video
- Step-by-step description
- Essential aspects
- Catalog information

> [!danger] The pages for each step still under construction

Each move also has a code, such as **C***C*01.

- The **first letter** indicates the broad category of the move.
- The *second letter* indicates a subcategory of the move. This may be absent if there is no subcategory; for example, B01 (Basic Move, Cataloged Step 1).
- The two-digit number is a sequential number.
- The letters used are based on the names of the categories.

Sometimes you will find a code like this: FC04.*01*

- This indicates move FC04: Grounded Figure number 4, with the first entry.

Another code presented is FC04*P*

- This indicates move FC04: Grounded Figure number 4, with trick P (puxada).

At the bottom of each page, you will find the catalog information:

- Movement Code.
- Connections: Other steps that are required to perform the step in question.
- Parent: The category to which the movement belongs.
