**Meio Giro** (half spin) consists of a half spin for both the lead and the follower.

**Lead**
1. The lead performs a [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]] but keeps the right hand on the side of the follower’s body. The right hand is intended to stop the follower from stepping back with the left foot. Using the same hand, gently pull the follower forward, keeping the hand on the follower’s body throughout the movement. This is called **tracing**, which helps the follower stay aware of the lead’s position. Be respectful of your touch.
2. Take a right step across to the left. Raise the left hand to the follower’s eye level, with the palm facing down. This hand will guide the follower during the turn. Be conscious of any adjustments the follower makes regarding the height of the hand.
3. Take a left step around the follower, turning to the right.
4. Perform a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the right, using the right hand to bring the follower in while executing the Basic 2.

**Follower**
1. Take a right step back, as in [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]]. However, the lead’s right hand will be on the follower’s side to prevent them from taking a second step back (with the left leg). This hand will provide momentum forward. Throughout the entire turn, this hand will indicate where the lead is.
2. Pivot on the left foot to the left and transfer the weight. The lead will raise the follower’s right hand up, keeping the palm facing up. The lead’s hand will guide the direction of the turn. Perform any necessary adjustments to the height of the hand.
3. Complete the turn by taking a right step forward.
4. Perform a [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] to the left. Pay attention to the lead’s hand on your back, as it will indicate when to reconnect.

**Key Elements of the Move**
- Leads must stop the follower’s momentum on step 1.
- Leads must provide intention for the follower to move backward, then forward on step 2.
- Leads should keep their right hand on the follower’s body during the spin. Be mindful of your touch.
- Leads, do not rush the turn. Your left hand is not making the follower spin; it serves only as a reference point.
- The lead’s left hand should follow the follower during the turn.
- Followers, you are responsible for performing the turn on your own. The lead’s left hand is just for guidance.
- Followers needs to walk the turn, transferring the weight on each step.
