The **Side Opening** is a variation of [[Kiz - Basic 2\|Basic 2]] where, instead of both partners moving in the same direction (to the left from the lead's perspective), they are moving in opposite directions. Normally, the lead moves to the right while the follower moves to the left. In this variation, both the lead and the follower will move to the right as they disconnect from each other. There is no difference for the follower; only the lead needs to change their steps.

The lead needs to slightly disconnect from the follower and transfer their weight to the left foot in order to step to the right. At the same time, they should indicate to the follower that nothing has changed by gently pushing them to the left.

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead must use their right arm to indicate to the follower that they are moving to their right.
