**Context:** Tug of war between Purple and Blue, where both are very strong like an old and huge tree. Purple is the past, Blue is the future, and the dying flower is me in the middle trying to reconcile the thoughts of Purple and Blue. It is on the brink of an explosion. This is one of the few pieces in horizontal alignment.
