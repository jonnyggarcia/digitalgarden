**Lead**
1. Perform the opening of the [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]] (90 degrees).
2. Push the follower with the right hand, and after they take a step, signal to close the passeio. Extend the left hand to receive the follower.

4. Repeat from step 2.

*Exiting*

**Follower**
1. The lead will signal to open as in [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]]. The weight is on the right foot.
2. Take a step forward with the left foot. Once the step is completed, the lead will indicate a pivot to the left by pressing their fingers against the follower’s back.
3. The follower completes a 180-degree turn to the left as they take a step with the right foot.
4. Take a step forward with the left foot to the left.
