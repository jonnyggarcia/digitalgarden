**Context:** This is about the absence of a person and the feeling of being left behind. Back in 2016 when Y moved back to Japan due to money and visa issues, I couldn’t happen to feel abandoned. In 2017, just one week after I started being in a relationship with S, she had to travel for a month. During that month we had skype conversations; during one of those calls, she mentioned she want to spend some time in Europe. I got triggered right away and started to cry. Once again I felt that was being left behind. During Christmas 2017, the relationship with S was not going well, lots of fights, so she decided she need sometime and spent Christmas and new year’s with friends leaving me alone at home during the holidays.
