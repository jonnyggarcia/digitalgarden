- How to spread

Artists do not exist in a vacuum. Humans are at their best when they are part of a community. Collective knowledge is greater than our individual knowledge, and therefore, we should share and join a community.

- Expand your community
- Build connections
- Exchange

Artists learn by doing. The final project:

- Statement of Practice
- Practice plan → goal
- It will be presented to the group in the end

# What is Art?

Comments made by the participants:

- It is about doing something.
- It is about an emotional reaction.
- Intentionality as you make it: playfulness and intuitiveness.
- Comprehend human experience. Dialoging. Different kinds of knowledge.
- Expression.
- A way of communicating.

## Technology of Art

A picture of a rock, is it art?

The moment it is added to a picture frame, it invites the viewer to think of it as art.

Just the picture of it (no frame), the questions are not the same as when they are in a frame. Paradox of truths.

**Before photography, art was about making a picture, but photography ruled it out. Despite doing picture making, we are more focused on experience making.**

Look beyond the object; what is the experience?

It is just a bed with stuff until we experience it.

Art goes beyond the edges of the frame. It is about the experience of making it.

Currently, we can experience art through a proxy, like immersive Van Gogh.

*Art as an experience, anything can be art.*

# What is Art?

Urban Institute: 96% value art, but only 27% value artists.

[*Professional Artist*](https://canadacouncil.ca/glossary/professional-artist) (Canada Council of Art)

- Specialized training in an artistic field not necessary from an institute.
- Recognized as a professional by their peers (artists working in the same tradition).
- Committed to devoting more time to artistic activity.
- History of public presentation or publication.
	- Anyone can make art, but the professional is the one to expose it and invite people to experience.

# Artist Practice

## Material

- What does the artist make?
- How do they make it?
- What materials do they use?
- What is their physical process?
	- Rip, cut.
- What is the workspace?

## Conceptual

- Why does the artist make what they do?
- What artist ideas inform their choices?
- What art history informs their work?
- What is their intellectual or emotional process?

## Experience

- How does the artist put their work out into the world?
- Who do they make art for?
	- If it is for yourself, why are you showing it?
- How do they engage with professionals?
- What is their environment?
	- What you have access to will influence your art.

Professionalism

- Organize the practice to have a deeper comprehension.
- Material + Conceptual + Experience.

## Model of Art Practice

![Framework - Art Practice.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Framework%20-%20Art%20Practice.png)

**Play and Research**

- Experimentation
- Research: inquiry with intention other than just looking at it.

**Process**

- Every artist has a unique process.
- How do you make what you make?
- You can have multiple processes.
- Different outcomes intend to guide the process: digital x analog x series x installation.
- Sometimes, other people are better to see the process due to our proximity.

**Making**

- It is constrained by many things: resources, environment.

**Finishing**

- Framing, no framing.
- Documentation, inventory.
- Title.

**Diffusion**

- How the work goes out into the world?
- The goal you have will inform what you will make.
	- Museum x artsy requires different pieces.

**Impact & Engagement**

- How do you engage people?
	- Sell, change the world, provoke conversation, shame people.
- What impact do you want to have?
- Find allies and partners.

---

Be aware of what needs to be done and work on it.

Approach the practice with intention, how to organize, how to diffuse.

# Collage Ancestors

**MODULE: Connecting with our Artistic Ancestors**

Find an example of a collage by an artist in a museum collection artist that dates to before 1990. The collage should speak to an element of your practice: a similar visual tradition, similar subject material, a shared aesthetic kinship, or some other connection. Post the collage to the ***arthistory*** channel in Slack along with your own collage it is in dialog with. Share your thoughts about the connection.
