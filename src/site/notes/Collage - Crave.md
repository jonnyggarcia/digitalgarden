**Context:** This collage is not dated, but the file was created on the backup on March 21, 2020, so I don’t have the precise date of its creation. I wonder why this piece was not signed. This collage used the prompt provided by Paris Collage Collective. This collage was done on the early stages of the covid-19, where people started to isolate themselves. This is about the feeling to be distant and isolated, which is represented by the diving suit. Inside the suit there is the memory of being with other people, although it is fuzzy. In contradiction, the outside is almost nonexistent and white. The whiteness represents the health protocols to avoid the spread of the virus. The nonexistence of the surrounding emphasizes the idea that during the isolation, people had to look inside. This collage is also part of the series Paris Collage Collective and B&W
