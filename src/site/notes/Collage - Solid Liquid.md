**Context:** This collage was a tentative to use abstraction. The certainty that rules provide, such as the traffic signs that guide us to be safe and organized, melts leaving only bleakness. The memories (woman) that bring pain and destabilize the certainty of life. The concepts and ideas that dissolves within time. This collage is also part of the series Abstract.
