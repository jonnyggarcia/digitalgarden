# Acknowledgement Exercise

[[How to improve certainty as a follower\|How to improve certainty as a follower]]

# Placement Exercise

This exercise aims to align the lead’s intention with their execution. The goal is for the lead to decide where to place the follower's weight, execute the step, and then ask the follower. The objective is for the follower’s answer to match the lead’s intention.

The follower should stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring their weight is evenly distributed on both feet and in a neutral position.

**Stage 1: Backwards and Forwards**

1. The lead decides between the following options:
	1. Back left: Weight on the left heel.
	2. Back right: Weight on the right heel.
	3. Front left: Weight on the left toes.
	4. Front right: Weight on the right toes.
2. Using their hands on the follower’s shoulders, the lead must move the follower’s chest to the desired spot.
3. Once completed, the lead asks the follower where their weight is.

Continue the exercise until the follower’s responses consistently match the lead’s intention several times in a row.

**Stage 2: Neutral**

1. Repeat the same exercise but add the following options:
	1. Back centered: Weight on both heels.
	2. Front centered: Weight on both toes.

**Stage 3: Centre**

1. Repeat the same exercise but add the following options:
	1. Center Left: Weight centered on the left foot.
	2. Center Neutral: Weight centered on both feet.
	3. Center Right: Weight centered on the right foot.

**Stage 4: Clear transitions**

- The lead must transition from one spot to the next directly, without hesitation. The follower must report if they feel any uncertainty from the lead.

# Balanced Walk Exercise

This exercise focuses on taking steps while maintaining full balance. The step is always aligned with the direction of the torso.

**Stage 1: Walk**

1. Raise one knee.
2. Take a normal stride step in any direction.
3. As soon as you land, raise the previous leg. You should be in balance. Stay still for 3 seconds to ensure you are balanced.

Make sure to practice this exercise by alternating the directions.

**Stage 2: Intensity**

- Same as Stage 1, but now take steps of varying lengths. Some steps should be very short, while others should require a jump.

**Stage 3: Assisted Walk**

1. Raise one knee.
2. Request someone to provide you with either a gentle pull or push.
3. Take the step and raise the previous leg.
4. Remain still for 3 seconds to ensure you are balanced.

**Stage 4: Intense Walk**

- Same as Stage 3, but now the person providing assistance will vary the intensity of the push or pull, which will dictate the length of the step.
