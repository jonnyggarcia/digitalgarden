# Acknowledgement Exercise

This exercise is based on the Japanese method called [**Shisa Kanko**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling) (pointing and calling). The goal of this exercise is to increase the follower’s awareness of what is happening in their body. There are 10 stages in this exercise. The couple should only move to the next step after several repetitions without any doubts.

**Stage 1 - Perception**

- The follower stands with their feet in a natural position.
- Using only their index finger, the lead will touch the follower's body.
- The follower will then announce where they have been touched.

**Stage 2 - Different Touch Signals**

- Same as stage 1, but now the lead can use:
	- One finger.
	- One finger on each hand.
	- Multiple fingers.
	- The whole hand.
	- The base of their hand.
- Now the follower needs to vocalize where they have been touched and with what kind of touch.

**Stage 3 - Intensity**

- Using the same types of touch, the lead will vary the intensity of the touch.
- The follower must indicate, in comparison to the previous touch, whether the current one is less, more, or the same intensity.

**Stage 4 - Intention**

- The lead will now provide a slight push or pull when touching the follower. This can be in the following directions:
	- Up
	- Down
	- Left
	- Right
	- Forward
	- Backward
	- Diagonal forward
	- Diagonal backward
- The follower should not take any steps and should comment on the direction of the touch.

**Stage 5 - Following**

- Now the follower does not need to vocalize what they are feeling. Instead, they will take a single step in the direction of the signal received.
	- The intensity of the touch should dictate the size of the step.
- The location of the touch will communicate different ideas to the follower:
	- A touch in the middle of the back signals a straight walk.
	- A touch on the edge of the torso or arms will indicate a turn.
	- A diagonal touch will indicate a crossing step.
	- A downward intention indicates a stop.
	- An upward intention indicates a leg lift.
- Reset to a neutral position before starting again.

**Stage 6 - Step**

- Now, instead of taking a single step, the follower will keep walking according to the signal received.
- Reset to a neutral position before starting again.

**Stage 7 - Stop**

- At any moment while the follower is walking, the lead will provide a signal in the opposite direction or with a downward intention to stop the follower.
- The timing of the stop signal is crucial. The lead should only signal to stop when the follower is grounded with both feet and before taking another step.
- The follower should stop without taking any additional steps.
- Reset and restart.

**Stage 8 - Signal Change**

- Same as stage 7, but instead of a stop signal, the lead will offer a new signal.
- The follower should abandon their current way of walking and follow the new signal.

# Placement Exercise

This exercise aims to align the lead’s intention with their execution. The goal is for the lead to decide where to place the follower's weight, execute the step, and then ask the follower. The objective is for the follower’s answer to match the lead’s intention.

The follower should stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring their weight is evenly distributed on both feet and in a neutral position.

**Stage 1: Backwards and Forwards**

1. The lead decides between the following options:
	1. Back left: Weight on the left heel.
	2. Back right: Weight on the right heel.
	3. Front left: Weight on the left toes.
	4. Front right: Weight on the right toes.
2. Using their hands on the follower’s shoulders, the lead must move the follower’s chest to the desired spot.
3. Once completed, the lead asks the follower where their weight is.

Continue the exercise until the follower’s responses consistently match the lead’s intention several times in a row.

**Stage 2: Neutral**

1. Repeat the same exercise but add the following options:
	1. Back centered: Weight on both heels.
	2. Front centered: Weight on both toes.

**Stage 3: Centre**

1. Repeat the same exercise but add the following options:
	1. Center Left: Weight centered on the left foot.
	2. Center Neutral: Weight centered on both feet.
	3. Center Right: Weight centered on the right foot.

**Stage 4: Clear transitions**

- The lead must transition from one spot to the next directly, without hesitation. The follower must report if they feel any uncertainty from the lead.

# Balanced Walk Exercise

This exercise focuses on taking steps while maintaining full balance. The step is always aligned with the direction of the torso.

**Stage 1: Walk**

1. Raise one knee.
2. Take a normal stride step in any direction.
3. As soon as you land, raise the previous leg. You should be in balance. Stay still for 3 seconds to ensure you are balanced.

Make sure to practice this exercise by alternating the directions.

**Stage 2: Intensity**

- Same as Stage 1, but now take steps of varying lengths. Some steps should be very short, while others should require a jump.

**Stage 3: Assisted Walk**

1. Raise one knee.
2. Request someone to provide you with either a gentle pull or push.
3. Take the step and raise the previous leg.
4. Remain still for 3 seconds to ensure you are balanced.

**Stage 4: Intense Walk**

- Same as Stage 3, but now the person providing assistance will vary the intensity of the push or pull, which will dictate the length of the step.
