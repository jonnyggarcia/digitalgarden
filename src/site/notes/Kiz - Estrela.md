[Estrela](https://youtu.be/gQFzVeXrZfg?si=B55Qe_DT8kFz3Y7v&t=1555)

From the lead's perspective, **Estrela (star)** is a forward [[Kiz - Basic 3\|Basic 3]] with a 90 degree turn to the right or left, then a basic 3 backwards. It is common to end the move with a balance.

*Key element of the move*
- The corner turn.
- Practice the key element back to back (left, balance, right).
