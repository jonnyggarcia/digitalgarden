**Pião** (spinning top) is a follower’s turn to the right that utilizes the momentum from the Passeio’s opening to execute the turn.

**Leads**
1. Ensure your right hand is well-positioned on the follower’s back, maintaining a good grip with your fingertips. Perform a 90-degree open, similar to [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]], while doing a flick to guide the follower’s right arm away (see [[Kiz - Desfile\|Desfile]]).
2. Mark a right step in place while continuing the follower’s momentum by pulling them toward yourself with your right hand.
3. Mark a left step in place.
4. Perform a Basic 2 to the right.

**Followers**
1. The lead will signal a 90-degree opening, similar to [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]] while performing a flick to your left arm (see [[Kiz - Desfile\|Desfile]]). Your weight will be on your right foot.
2. The lead will pull their right hand, resting on your back, causing you to rotate 180 degrees to your right, which will lead you to take a left step.
3. Complete another 180-degree turn, now facing the lead, while taking a right step.
4. Perform a Basic 2 to the left.

*Key elements of the move*
- Leads need to perform the flick in Step 1 to guide the follower’s arm away.
- Leads must provide enough momentum in Step 2 so the follower can complete the 360-degree turn.
- Followers must walk through the turn, transferring their weight as they do so.
