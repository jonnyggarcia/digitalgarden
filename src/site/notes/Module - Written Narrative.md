# How To Write Your Statement of Practice

In addition to making a final presentation, we invite you to send a written narrative about your practice. To that end, consider the following:

## STEP ONE: Understanding Your Artist Practice

**Artist Practice** = Play & Research >>> Process >>> Making >>> Finishing>>> Diffusion >>> Impact & Engagement

Let's unpack this a little.

A Statement of Practice is a summary of what you make and why and the context in which you operate. An artist's life and work can be broken up into components the totality of which becomes their practice.

### Bio

***Generally speaking, who are you and how do you come to this work? For example, "Paola de la Calle is a Colombian-American interdisciplinary artist whose work examines home, borders, identity, and nostalgia." "Natalie Vestin is a writer, artist, and infectious disease researcher from Saint Paul, Minnesota." This is a one sentence summary of your bio.***

### Play & Research

***How do you gather data and learn about the world? What is the role of play in your creative process? This is where you speak about the ideas you explore or investigate or are concerned with. (There is a reason those verbs in artist statements have become commonplace.)***

I create art inspired by self-imposed projects with specific criteria, aiming to establish a unique language among the pieces and foster my creativity.

### Process

***What process do you use to turn information into art? How do you start to think about a poem or a collage? Process is conceptual. It is how marks and materials become ideas.***

In my artistic journey, I contend with the intricate challenges arising from Alexithymia, a condition known as emotional blindness that hinders the identification and verbal expression of my emotions, leaving an unsettling void. My art serves as a response to this unique struggle, offering me a means to navigate and comprehend the complexities of my emotional landscape.

The choice of digital medium over analog is intentional, driven by a desire for creative freedom. My difficulty in articulating emotions verbally, due to Alexithymia, also know as emotional blindness, serves as a significant constraint, and digital tools provide me with the liberation to experiment, modify, and adapt visual symbols seamlessly. This freedom is essential in conveying the intricacies of my emotional experiences. In essence, my digital collage practice becomes a therapeutic journey, enabling me to translate the ineffable into a visual language that facilitates both self-understanding and connection with others who may share similar struggles.

I also engage in art-making by immersing myself in a specific idea through various mediums, including texts, images, videos, and songs. In many instances, the melodies of songs serve as a catalyst, influencing my inner mental state and preparing me to engage in the art-making process.

### Object Making

***What do you make? What materials do you use? What is the significance of those materials and processes?***

My art-making process typically begins by scrolling through royalty-free images, with the majority sourced from Unsplash.com, using specific keywords. Occasionally, I incorporate selfies taken recently or images of people I personally know. Once a selection of images is saved, I embark on the process of making alterations to convey a specific intention.

Digital tools enable the application of techniques that are challenging to replicate in analog formats. Through the use of an iPad, Apple Pencil, and the Procreate app, I delve into the process of eliminating contrast commonly created when juxtaposing images. Although each individual element remains recognizable, they are distilled to only what is essential for conveying meaning.

Colour is intentionally applied using a limited and harmonious palette. The human figure, particularly bodies, hands, and faces, is a recurrent element in my work, blended with abstract paintings and set against unobtrusive backgrounds. This fusion of diluted elements creates a visual synergy that goes beyond the sum of its parts, giving rise to a cohesive new digital image. Throughout the entire process, it is not uncommon for me to listen to one specific song on a loop.

### Finishing

***What things do you do in your practice that facilitate the work of other art professionals? How do you document your work? How do you approach titles? Do you maintain an inventory? How do you label your images? What is your work for storage? How do you approach framing?***

I dedicate a significant amount of time to maintaining a well-organized inventory of all my artworks. Each piece is named and bears a stamp with the date and signature on its front. For every established project, there is a set convention for naming each piece, while collages not part of a specific project are named based on intuition.

Ensuring the preservation of my work, the original digital files are securely backed up on the cloud. Additionally, a high-resolution digital image is generated and stored both on the cloud and my phone. To showcase my collages, I display them on Instagram and maintain a personal website.

I adopt a systematic approach to cataloging my collages, creating a file for each piece that includes a detailed description of all elements present, using hashtags for efficient searches. This method enables me to identify patterns in the most commonly used elements, colours, and the number of collages created each year.

For collages requiring printing, sale, or exhibition, vital information such as title, year, owner, and quantity of prints is registered on the back of the piece. I maintain a document detailing the records of printed collages and exhibitions. The destination of each piece determines whether I print it myself or engage a professional print company. This decision also influences the framing process, choosing between a simple frame from an art supply store or a custom frame based on the specific requirements.

### Diffusion

***How do you put your art out into the world? Do you show in galleries or make books? Do you exhibit in nontraditional art spaces or are you focused on museums? This may include past and future methods of diffusion.***

I disseminate my work through various channels, including participating in calls for artists, utilizing Instagram, and maintaining a personal website. Over the past three years, I have compiled high-quality books curated with 20 to 25 collages created during each respective year.

Looking ahead to 2024, I plan to enhance my strategy by dedicating more effort to applying for calls for artists. Additionally, I am embarking on a collaborative project with two other artists, aiming to develop a cohesive body of work. The intention is to produce a proposal for presentation to galleries and curators.

### Impact & Engagement

***What do you want viewers to experience? How do you want to impact your community?***

No Sure

### ACTIVITY

Copy the Artist Statement you submitted in your application to the residency to a new document. Break up the statement so that each sentence is its own paragraph. Then, label each sentence using one of the categories above. What did you find? What is overemphasized? What is missing?

## STEP TWO: Understanding Your Collage

See this: <http://www.kasinihouse.com/lab-materials/modules/artist-as-historian.html>

Interrogate your collage as if it was made by another person. Using only the information contained in the work itself, try to answer the following questions:

### ACTIVITY

- What is it? What is it similar to?
- Who made it?
- When and where was it created?
- What does it tell you? What does it not tell you?
- Why was it created?

The question, What is it similar to?, is potentially key. Is the style similar to another artist? Does the work reflect a type of art movement? For example, if the work is photomontage, is it more in the style of the Dadaists or the Surrealists? 

Once you identify your cultural ancestors, you can turn to them to inform the language you use to speak about your work. What words did they use to describe their work? What language did writers about their work use?

## STEP THREE: Open A Bottle Of Wine

A pair of artists I know have a helpful process for creating text about their artwork. Once the work is complete, they hang it on the wall, open a bottle of wine, turn on a voice recorder, and start talking about the work. One will often pose questions to the other. What is it? What do you want the viewer or reader to get from it? Who is this for? The recording is sometimes transcribed and becomes the basis of a statement. 

Another technique is to handwrite a letter to the viewer or reader. Imagine a person you want to see the artwork or read the poem, take out a blank piece of paper, and write to them about what you were thinking when you made it. 

### ACTIVITY

Try one of the above exercises or invent your own. It sometimes takes 1000 words to get 200 good words. These exercises are opportunities to pause and reflect on the work, one's practice, and one's place in the larger culture.

# STEP FOUR: Write

## ACTIVITY

***Take the best sentences from the exercises above and organize them into a coherent statement. Use the headings below. Ask other people to read and reflect on it. Edit as needed.***

- ***Bio***
- ***Play & Research***
- ***Process***
- ***Making***
- ***Diffusion***
- ***Impact***
- ***Goal***

### Bio
