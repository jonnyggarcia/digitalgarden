Steal Like an Artist" by [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) is a concise guide offering practical advice on the process of art creation. The author emphasizes that every artist draws inspiration from others and encourages the concept of "stealing" ideas, which involves incorporating elements from existing works into one's own creations. Kleon suggests that this act of borrowing and adapting is a legitimate and valuable approach to artistic expression, urging artists to embrace the notion of copying and transforming borrowed ideas into something uniquely their own.

What's considered original is really just a blend of various sources until it becomes unrecognizable, and the references get a bit blurry. Every fresh idea is pretty much constructed on what's already hanging around.

Realizing that nothing is entirely new can release you from the pressure to be this super-original genius. Instead, you can dive into what's already out there without holding back. Take a look at your own life – you're this mix of influences that sets you apart, even from folks who grew up right next to you.

Novelty is basically stumbling upon something you didn't know about but was already kicking around.

Considering our innate tendency to incorporate references, the responsibility lies with us to determine our surroundings. Through the deliberate curation of influences, we significantly impact the nature of our creative output. As an artist, your primary task is to amass a collection of compelling ideas. The broader your collection, the greater the range of options at your disposal.

*Comment:* In his book, "The Creative Act," Rick Rubin delves into the concept of elevating one's greatness.

One approach to integrating new ideas involves thoroughly studying the work of a specific thinker you love from any mediums Following this, explore the influences of that individual by delving into the works of three people who played a role in shaping their ideas. This sequence establishes your intellectual lineage.

*Comment:* In the [[Collage in Practice Workshop - Notes\|Collage Workshop in Practice]], we had a module aimed at identifying our [[Module - Ancestors\|ancestors]]. The objective was to locate an artwork, created before 1990 and housed in a collection anywhere in the world, that resonates with one of our own creations. The exercise focused on understanding how the chosen artwork has been described and establishing connections with artists from the past.

The world is packed with ideas, and it's your chance to be curious and explore. Always have a notebook with you, like a common book. Jot down everything – talks, cool quotes, doodles, whatever catches your interest. And also, keep a Swipe File for things you pick up from others. Some people call it a morgue file, a stash of things to bring back to life later.

The journey of self-discovery is tied directly to taking action. The reassuring part is that nobody has it all figured out. The source of good art remains a mystery, but those who create consistently are bound to stumble upon it.

*Comment:* This sentiment aligns closely with Rick Rubin's thoughts in [[The Creative Act\|The Creative Act]]. Additionally, in [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]], the book delves into the concept of identity and how our habits play a crucial role in shaping it. Much like a doctor practices medicine daily, an artist is dedicated to their craft every day.

To be an artist, all you really need to do is create art. Developing your voice and style comes with practice, it's not something you're born with. A useful way to learn is by imitating what you admire. But here's the thing – it's not just mindlessly copying; it's more like reverse-engineering. It's about breaking down the elements to understand how they work. 

Remember when you took things apart as a kid to see how they worked? It's a bit like that. When we were little, we learned the alphabet by copying those letters over and over again. Similarly, painters often reproduce masterpieces to hone their skills. The key is to go beyond just mimicking the style. Understand the thought process, see the world the way they do. You want to internalize a way of seeing things rather than just copying the technique, or you'll end up with mere replicas. Aim to emulate, not merely copy.

Over time, your efforts to emulate and the various influences you absorb will naturally culminate in something unique to you. Perfect replicas are impossible; we inevitably infuse our creations with bits of ourselves. It's in the mistakes and deviations from the original that our uniqueness truly emerges.

Consider creating fan fiction. The longing for more of something you love can be channeled into a productive outlet. Ask yourself: What was missed in the original? How could it be improved? What if the same thing were made today? What if your favorite artists collaborated under your direction? These questions can spark imaginative and personalized creations.

Relying solely on a computer can hinder the creative process. People glued to their screens often become stagnant, impacting both their well-being and the quality of their work. Engaging your body, not just your mind, is crucial. Let your physical self be part of your creative journey. While computers excel at editing and preparing ideas for publication, they fall short in generating ideas. The temptation to undo mistakes can steer us towards perfection, moving away from the exploration of uncharted creative territory.

*Comment:* Personally, my work is entirely digital; I create on my iPad at my office desk. I don't feel it's hindering my work. The internet, with its endless ideas, is at my fingertips. I believe it's more about personal preference. While I can tweak and backtrack endlessly, creating art that leaves me dissatisfied doesn't inspire me to create more.

Push yourself to go through the motions, whether it's strumming the guitar or kneading clay, to get into the creative zone. Experiment with side projects and indulge in activities you typically do when procrastinating. Even taking time off and doing nothing can be part of the artistic process. Mundane tasks like ironing may unexpectedly spark good ideas. Art is about exploration and playfulness; you'll never know what might emerge from it.

Don't neglect your passions. Spend quality time with them and find ways to integrate them into your creative pursuits. Let them converse with each other. Engage in activities for yourself without the pressure to be professional or meet deadlines. Don't worry too much; just keep creating. Over time, you'll see how everything starts to make sense.

Being in school is fantastic because your instructor and classmates are there to pay attention to what you do. Unfortunately, this supportive environment is often lacking outside of educational settings. The upside, however, is that in today's society, the internet allows us to transcend geographical barriers. You have the power to create your own world.

*Comment:* The book [[Show your Work\|Show Your Work]] by the same author emphasizes the concept of being part of a "scenius". It suggests being part of a community that can provide support and encouragement.

In reality, people may not always care or appreciate what you do. Interestingly, this can be a positive aspect because the pressure to perform is reserved for instances of truly exceptional work. Attention, especially when money is involved, can come with constraints. It's crucial to be at ease with being ignored, misunderstood, or criticized. The key is to stay focused on the work itself.

Negative comments are inevitable, but so are positive ones. Save the positive feedback, and when you need a confidence boost, revisit them. However, it's important not to overuse them, as their impact diminishes with excessive repetition.

Often, people recognize the value of your work when you've already moved on or are no longer around. Don't actively seek external validation. Release your work into the world and let it go, as you don't have control over how it's perceived.

Share your work and passions openly, creating a connection between people and your art. Fearlessly reveal your creative process, as people appreciate this transparency and it may even inspire them to support you financially. The internet serves as both an idea incubator and a display platform. You don't need to share everything—just focus on what you're currently working on and what holds value for others.

Exercise caution, though, as everything on the internet is discoverable. Disregard trolls and focus on spreading positivity. While it's natural to feel anger at misinformation, it's not always worth addressing; instead, channel that energy into your work.

Franz Kafka wrote, “It isn’t necessary that you leave home. Sit at your desk and listen. Don’t even listen, just wait. Don’t wait, be still and alone. The whole world will offer itself to you.” — location: 406

Create a space filled with things you love; tape stuff to the walls, and set aside dedicated time to be alone with your thoughts. Your living environment significantly influences your work, so don't get too comfortable—venture outside your comfort zone. The weather, too, plays a role; bad weather might encourage you to stay indoors and focus on your work.

*Comment:* It's interesting to note that some people attribute the strong larp (live-action role-playing) culture in Nordic countries to their harsh winters.

Creativity thrives on energy, and if your life is out of balance due to chaos, it can affect your ability to create art. Strive for an organized and stable life that provides the space for artistic expression. Financial literacy is key, so invest time in learning about money; you'll be grateful for it. Resist the consumer culture, save as much money as possible, and adopt a budget-conscious lifestyle. This financial stability can contribute to the mental and emotional equilibrium necessary for fostering creativity.

“Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.” —Gustave Flaubert — location: 508

It's quite common to have a day job while pursuing your art, and that's perfectly okay. Financial freedom often translates into the freedom to create art. Look for a job that not only pays the bills but also offers opportunities to learn skills that can benefit your artistic endeavors. Making art often means dedicating time on weekends, holidays, and even when you're not feeling well. Consistency matters, so focus on doing small things repeatedly to make progress over time.

Tracking your work and daily activities can be a helpful tool in maintaining a routine for creating art.

Additionally, consider that choosing your life partner is one of the most significant decisions you'll ever make. This decision not only influences your personal life but also extends to the people you'll encounter, do business with, and surround yourself with.

Having infinite options can be overwhelming and lead to creative block. To overcome this, consider self-imposing constraints. These limitations can push you to take action.

Create with what you currently have—whether it's time, money, resources, space, or materials. Working within constraints often sparks creativity and helps break through creative blocks.
