Basic 3 requires the lead to have clear intention, which is communicated through the chest. The intention happens when the lead transfer the weight to their toes (walking forward), to their heels (walking backwards).

---

**Lead walking forward**

- When walking forward the legs can only step when there is space.

1. Lead shifts the weight towards their toes causing the chest to move forward
2. Follower steps back
3. Lead step forward

**Lead walking backwards**

- When walking backwards the leg goes first and then the chest follows.

1. Lead shifts the weight towards their heels creating a space for the follower.
2. Lead step backward
3. Follower steps forward chasing their partners chest

For the followers it is important for them to walk by themselves instead of being dragged by the lead.

Leads needs to communicate when to change directions. That happens para decelerating.

- The follower is looking to be connected with their partners as a first rule, and then with their steps. The steps happen in favor of the connection and not the other way around.
- It is easier for the follower to notice change in direction when they are walking forward because when the lead stops, the follower cannot walk forward. However, when the follower is walking backwards, there is nothing to stop them to keep walking.

**Progression 1 - Arm to Arm connection**
- Arm to arm connection (leads down, palms up)
- Play with weight forward, back, side to side. No one moves the leg.
- Play with weight forward, back. Follower steps accordingly with the intention felt and empty leg.
- Play with weight forward, back. Follower steps accordingly with the intention felt and empty leg. Leads follow.

**Progression 2 - Ball connection**
- Pilates ball between partners. Move back and forth.
- When the ball falls, it only means there is a disconnection, therefore the dancers need to talk about what happened.
- The ball will be squeezed and and unsqueezed depending on the syncrinocity between partners. In a perfect scenario, the ball should have a constant pressure during walk.
- When the ball rolls side to side, it means someone is shifting their weight to the side while they walk. Possibly needs to have the legs a little closer to each other.
- Before moving to the next step it is important for the follower:
	- Clearly distinguish when there is a change in direction.
	- Always walk with the correct leg

**Progression 3 - Chest to chest connection**
- Despite having the arms to provide additional information, the main focus should be on the chest.
- Introduce the *Marca* as change in direction.
- Introduce walk with curves

> [!danger] The traditional drill of 2 steps plus marca should not be used as a reference when there is a change in direction. The change should be perceived by the follower and not memorised. The lead must provide clear and crisp intention.

**Progression 4 - No armas connection**
- Same as progression 3, but no arm connection. Only chest.
