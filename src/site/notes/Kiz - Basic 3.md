**Basic 3** requires the lead to have clear intention, which is communicated through the chest. The intention is conveyed when the lead pushes the follower backward with their chest, or when they walk backwards and have the right arm in place to bring the follower forward.

**Lead Walking Forward**

When walking forward, the lead's legs can only step when there is space.

1. The lead shifts their weight toward their toes, causing the chest to move forward.
2. The follower steps back towards their partner, which is slightly to the right.
3. The lead steps forward.

Note: Every single step is accompanied buy a brief touch of the thighs.

**Lead Walking Backward**

When walking backward, the leg moves first, followed by the chest.

1. The lead indicates the intention to move backward by shifting their torso back. This action increases the pressure of the lead’s right arm against the follower’s back.
2. The lead steps backward maintaining the weight forward. To maintain the thigh connection with every step, the lead needs to move slightly to their left, causing the follower to shift to their right.
3. The follower steps forward, following their partner's chest.

- For the followers, it is important to walk independently rather than being dragged by the lead.
- Leads need to communicate when to change directions, which happens by decelerating. When walking backward, the lead’s torso will indicate changes in speed. When walking forward, the lead’s right arm will convey this information.
- The follower should first maintain connection with their partner and then with their steps. The steps should support the connection, not the other way around.
- It is easier for the follower to notice a change in direction when walking forward because, when the lead stops, the follower cannot continue walking forward. However, when the follower is walking backward, there is nothing to prevent them from continuing to walk. To minimize that, the lead's right arm can support the follower's chest to prevent them from stepping back.

**Progression 1: Arm-to-Arm Connection**

- Arm-to-arm connection (leads' arms down, palms up).
- Practice shifting weight forward, back, side-to-side. No leg movement.
- Practice shifting weight forward and back. The follower steps according to the intention felt and the empty leg.
- Practice shifting weight forward and back with the follower stepping according to the felt intention and empty leg. Leads follow.

**Progression 2: Ball Connection**

- Use a Pilates ball between partners to move back and forth.
- If the ball falls, it indicates a disconnection; the dancers need to discuss what happened.
- The ball will be squeezed and unsqueezed depending on the synchronicity between partners. Ideally, the ball should maintain constant pressure during the walk.
- If the ball rolls side-to-side, it means someone is shifting their weight to the side while walking. The legs may need to be closer together.

Before moving to the next step, it is important for the follower to:

  - Clearly recognize changes in direction.
  - Always walk with the correct leg.

**Progression 3: Chest-to-Chest Connection**

- While arms provide additional information, the main focus should be on the chest.
- Introduce the *Marca* as a change in direction.
- Introduce walking with curves. This should led with the pivoting of the chest.

> [!info] The traditional drill of 2 steps plus marca should not be used as a reference for changes in direction. The change should be perceived by the follower, not memorized. The lead must provide clear and precise intention.

**Progression 4: No Arms Connection**
- Same as progression 3, but without arm connection—only chest.

*Key elements of the move*

- Leads should be aware of where the follower’s weight is and be able to redirect it.
- Leads should provide a clear intention before start walking.
- When walking forward, the torso moves first, followed by the legs.
- When stepping backward, the leg moves first, followed by the torso.
- The walk is not in a straight line but rather directed toward the partner.
- The follower moves in response to the push or disconnection of the lead’s torso.
- Regardless of the direction of the walk, the weight always remains on the balls of the feet.
- Followers should consistently seek connection with their partner’s chest. When walking forward, it is their responsibility to move forward and maintain the connection, rather than being dragged by the lead.
