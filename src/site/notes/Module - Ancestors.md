# Ancestors

**MODULE: Connecting with our Artistic Ancestors**
Find an example of a collage by an artist in a museum collection artist that dates to before 1990. The collage should speak to an element of your practice: a similar visual tradition, similar subject material, a shared aesthetic kinship, or some other connection. Post the collage to the ***arthistory*** channel in Slack along with your own collage it is in dialog with. Share your thoughts about the connection.

As an immigrant from Brazil, I frequently engage in the creation of digital collages that reflect my journey and cultural background, often drawing inspiration from elements such as music. In my quest for Brazilian artists specializing in collages, I stumbled upon Abraham Palatnik while exploring the collection of MASP (Museu de Arte de São Paulo - Art Museum of São Paulo).

Abraham Palatnik, born in Brazil in 1928, underwent a period of migration, moving to Mandatory Palestine between 1932 and 1947 before returning to Brazil, where he spent the majority of his life. Intriguingly, this shared experience of being an immigrant adds a personal connection to his work.

Renowned as a pioneer in technological art in Brazil, Palatnik's artistic approach differs significantly from mine, yet I find a commonality in our work with technology.

For this assignment, I selected an untitled abstract collage from 1980 in the MASP collection. Executed on Cartão (cardboard) with dimensions of 48 x 48 cm, it lacks a specific title and abstains from depicting reality. Although the exact technique used remains unclear, the piece can be explored further on MASP's website [here](https://masp.org.br/en/collections/works/untitled-21).

In parallel, I present one of my own works titled [Abstract](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ7zCiLudmA/). This piece, showcased on my Instagram, simulates an abstract painting but is, in fact, a fusion of various paintings into a cohesive new creation. I selected this piece for its shared abstract qualities and the evident lines, which echo the characteristics found in Palatnik's work
