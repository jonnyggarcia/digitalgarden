**How to Improve the Decisiveness of the Follower**

Some followers may hesitate to take a step, often because they feel uncertain about are they supposed to do. This hesitation is likely due to a lack of training in body awareness. By developing greater body awareness and learning to trust their bodies as a source of information, followers can overcome this hesitation and respond more confidently to the lead’s signals.

**How to Develop Body Awareness**

Many people are unaware of what is happening in their bodies, especially in terms of the direction their body is moving. Developing body awareness requires active attention to notice and differentiate between the various stimuli the body receives.

A related challenge is knowing how to respond to certain signals. This can be addressed through association training: when receiving signal X, the response should be action Y.

Inspired by **Shisa Kanko**, the Japanese point-calling system, the following exercise is designed to enhance both physical and mental awareness of what is happening and how to respond.

**Stage 1 - Perception**
- The follower stands still in a neutral position with their eyes closed.
- The lead uses their index finger to touch a specific part of the follower’s body.
- The follower will then announce where they have been touched.

**Stage 2 - Different Touch Signals**
- The lead should now use different types of touch signals:
	- Single fingertip
	- Single fingertip but both hands
	- Multiple fingertips
	- Whole palm
	- Base of the palm
- Now the follower needs to vocalize where they have been touched and with what kind of touch.

**Stage 3 - Intensity**
- The lead should now incorporate varying levels of pressure when touching the follower.
- The follower must indicate, in comparison to the previous touch, whether the current one is less, more, or the same intensity.

**Stage 4 - Intention**
- The lead should attempt to convey the following directional intentions through their touch, without moving either their own body or the follower’s body:
	- Forward
	- Backward
	- Side step to the left
	- Side step to the right
	- Turn to the left
	- Turn to the right
	- Upward
	- Downward
	- Diagonal forward
	- Diagonal backward
- The follower should describe:
	- Where they are being touched
	- How they are being touched
	- The intensity of the touch
	- The intended direction conveyed by the touch

**Stage 5 - Weight**
- The lead will use both hands to adjust the follower’s weight without making them take a step.
- Places where to move the weight:
	- Toes
	- Ankles
	- Neutral
	- Left side
	- Right side
- The lead will then proceed to use only one hand.
- Next, the lead will use multiple fingers.
- Finally, the lead will use just one finger to guide the weight.
- The follower should describe where their weight is positioned throughout the process.

**Stage 6 - Following**
- Once the follower receives a stimulus, they should independently continue the movement.
- The follower should focus solely on weight shifting, without taking any steps. They should describe the signals they received and how they responded.
- Directions to work on include:
	- Forward
	- Backward
	- Diagonally
	- Sides
	- Upward
	- Downward

**Stage 7 - Step**
- The lead should use both hands to direct the follower’s weight.
- The lead will then provide a signal, as described in the previous stages.
- Once the follower receives the signal, they should take one step in the indicated direction. The lead should not assist with the step.
- The intensity of the touch should dictate the size of the step.
- After the step, the follower should comment on their experience.
- The location of the touch will communicate different ideas to the follower:
	- A touch in the middle of the back signals a straight walk.
	- A touch on the edge of the torso or arms will indicate a turn.
	- A diagonal touch will indicate a crossing step.
	- A downward intention indicates a stop.
	- An upward intention indicates a leg lift.
- Reset to a neutral position before starting again.

**Stage 8 - Stop**
- The follower will continue to follow their signal until they feel an indication to stop their movement.
- At any moment while the follower is moving, the lead will provide a signal in the opposite direction or with a downward intention to stop the follower.
- The timing of the stop signal is crucial. The lead should only signal to stop when the follower is grounded with both feet and before taking another step.
- The follower should stop without taking any additional steps.
- Reset to a neutral position before starting again.

 **Stage 9 - Signal Change**
 - The follower will move in response to the initial signal.
- While the follower is in motion, the lead will provide a new signal.
- The follower will complete the current movement by finalizing the weight transfer and then change their movement to follow the new signal.
- Leads must be precise about when to provide a new signal.

**Stage 10 - Turn**
- The lead should introduce turns and pivots as a continuation of Stage 9.

**Stage 11 - Lifts**
- The lead should introduce the signal to indicate a lift for the leg.
