# Framework

This is an attempt to dissect Kizomba with the intention of identifying its components so that we can explore each of them and better understand how to transmit the dance to another person. In no way am I trying to restrict or define what Kizomba is. I approach this as an observer of the dance, trying to understand what it is made of.

Here is a basic diagram representing the framework—the technical structure—of Kizomba. The cultural aspect of the dance is not contemplated in this diagram.

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - FRAMEWORK.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20FRAMEWORK.png)

**Position** refers to how the dancers’ bodies relate to each other. Usually, the follower mirrors the lead. **Signals** are the information transmitted from the lead to the follower to indicate what is coming next. Through signals, the lead initiates movement, referred to here as **locomotion**.

Signals are conveyed using different parts of the body, which are referred to as **body tools** in this framework. These signals guide the follower into a certain **direction**, which is then followed by some form of locomotion. Another quality of a signal is its **intensity**, which influences the energy or emphasis of the movement.

In general, Kizomba is a circular dance. However, many steps are executed in short straight lines—for example, Basic 2 or Basic 3. If we imagine a Cartesian plane, like in math graphs, movement can happen along the **vertical axis (Y)** or the **horizontal axis (X)**. Signals can also communicate a **change in direction**, either through a stop or by adding an **angled step**.

# Position

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - POSITION.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20POSITION.png)

The basic position in Kizomba is the **embrace**, where the lead and follower face each other in a friendly, close hold. They can also be positioned **side by side**, facing the same direction or facing opposite directions.

The **perpendicular position** refers to an **L or T shape**, where the lead is usually facing the follower, but the follower is not directly facing the lead. This creates an angular relationship between their bodies.

A commonly used variation is the **shadow position**, where the lead stands slightly behind and to the left of the follower, with both facing the same direction. There are a few instances where the follower is positioned behind the lead, which I refer to as the **reverse shadow position**.

Finally, there are a few movements in which the lead and follower are **almost entirely disconnected**, with minimal physical contact or even momentary separation.

# Locomotion

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - LOCOMOTION.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20LOCOMOTION.png)

Kizomba is known as a walking dance. In this framework, movement—or the absence of it—is referred to as **locomotion**.

From the lead’s perspective, movement can occur **forward and backward** (along the **vertical axis**, or **Y**) and **side to side** (along the **horizontal axis**, or **X**). Diagonals are created by combining a vertical with a horizontal locomotion. Circular movements, on the other hand, are created by combining linear steps with **angled steps**. A series of consecutive angled steps can result in a circular pattern, as seen in movements like Corridinho. Effectively, every time an angle is added to a movement, a new plane of motion is created.

Lastly, the **absence of movement** is also part of this framework. **Stops**, such as in the movement **Marca**, are often used to **change direction** or to **establish connection** with the partner.

# Body Tools

The lead communicates with the follower primarily through touch, using different parts of the body. Below is a list of the body parts used to communicate, roughly in order of importance. Some of these parts share equal relevance depending on the context. This should not be confused with the **connection points** between the lead and the follower.

1. Chest
2. Right Hand
3. Right Arm
4. Thighs
5. Eyes
6. Knee
7. Left hand
8. Feet
9. Head

Each body tool can perform different **actions**, each producing different results. The same action, when executed with a different body part, can lead to a completely different outcome. Below is a list of the actions used in the leading process.

- Angle
- Crossing
- Disconnection
- Elevation (upward and downward)
- Locomotion (horizontal and vertical)
- Observe
- Pressure
- Pull
- Steadiness
- Stepping

The following diagrams present each of the **body tools** (in green), the possible **actions** (in yellow), and the resulting effect from the **follower’s perspective** (in red).

## Chest

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - CHEST.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20CHEST.png)

**Horizontal locomotion** (horizontal locomotion) causes the follower to also move horizontally (side step), as they are actively engaging with the lead’s chest.

**Pressure**
- **Backward Locomotion**: When the lead moves forward, the chest applies gentle pressure against the follower’s chest. This creates a signal for the follower to step backward, maintaining the chest-to-chest connection.
- **Stop**: When the lead walks backward and stops (marca), the follower’s forward momentum causes their torso to press against the lead’s chest. This increased chest pressure serves as a signal to the follower to stop their movement.

**Angle**
- **Dissociation**: The follower’s hips remain aligned forward while the chest angles toward the lead, creating a twist in the upper body. This prepares the follower for redirection without immediately moving the base.
- **Pivot**: Because the follower is actively connected to the lead’s chest, when the lead pivots, it causes the follower to pivot as well. This is commonly used to initiate turns or transitions between planes.
- **Circular Motion**: Maintaining a slight, sustained angle while moving can lead the follower into a circular trajectory, as seen in patterns like Corridinho.

**Disconnection**: When the lead moves away from the follower, it creates a moment of disconnection. However, because the follower is actively “chasing” the lead’s chest, they will move forward to reestablish connection.

**Elevation**: the upward or downward movement of the torso—causes a corresponding movement in the follower’s body.

## Right Hand

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - RIGHT HAND.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20RIGHT%20HAND.png)

The right hand is divides in three parts: **Fingers**, **Palm**, and **Base**. Each part, through the application of pressure, can lead to distinct follower responses.

**Fingers**

When the fingers apply **pressure**, they can trigger a variety of follower responses:

- **Vertical locomotion**: prompting the follower to step forward or backward when applied against the follower’s ribs from a side-to-side position.
- **Horizontal locomotion**: encouraging side-to-side movement.
- **Stop**: signalling a pause, a hold in movement, or a change in direction.
- **Unbalance**: momentarily disrupting the follower’s equilibrium, often used to initiate dips or dynamic transitions.

**Palm**

When pressure is applied using the **palm**, it tends to produce:

- **Forward locomotion**: inviting the follower to step forward.
- **Stop**: signalling a halt in motion.

**Base**

The **base** of the hand (closer to the wrist) communicates through pressure to generate:

- **Angle**: introducing a directional change, often used to open the follower 90 degrees.
- **Horizontal locomotion**: side-to-side movement, similar to the fingers but often used with a broader contact.

## Right Arm

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOKS - RIGHT ARM.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOKS%20-%20RIGHT%20ARM.png)

**Pressure**

When the right arm applies **pressure**, it can lead to:

- **Stop**: communicates a pause, a hold in movement, or a change in direction.
- **Forward locomotion** – encourages the follower to walk forward.
- **Horizontal locomotion** – prompts side-to-side movement.
- **Syncopation** – introduces rhythmic variation, often used to lead musical accents or off-beat steps.

**Steadiness**

By maintaining a consistent and steady position, the right arm helps establish and reinforce **Chest connection**, creating a strong point of contact between the partners’ upper bodies, which enhances responsiveness and control.

**Elevation**

When the right arm slightly **lifts**, it can lead to **Leg raises**. The follower to lift a leg, typically used in stylized movements or embellishments.

## Thigh

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - THIGH.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20THIGH.png)

**Pressure**

When the lead uses the **thigh to apply pressure**, it can prompt the following follower actions:

- **Backward locomotion**: the follower steps back, initiated through forward thigh pressure.
- **Horizontal locomotion** – a side-to-side step triggered by lateral thigh contact.
- **Stop**: halts movement, used to signal a pause or reset.

**Elevation**

When the right arm slightly **lifts**, it can lead to **Leg raises**. The follower to lift a leg, typically used in stylized movements or embellishments.

## Eyes

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOLS - EYES.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOLS%20-%20EYES.png)

By observing their partner, they can synchronize their movements. For the follower in particular, **visual observation** is essential to mirror the lead’s chest and respond accordingly, especially when physical contact is minimal or the connection point shifts.

## Knee

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - KNEE.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20KNEE.png)

Leads can use their knee to create elevation by lifting the follower’s leg.

## Left Hand

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - LEFT HAND.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20LEFT%20HAND.png)

**Crossing The Body**

- When the lead's **left hand crosses the follower’s body**, it usually signals a **rotation in the frame**, often leading to a **turn** for the follower.

**Pressure**

- **Stop**: A firm or anchored pressure communicates a pause, halting movement or preparing for a change in direction.
- **Locomotion**: Can guide the follower into horizontal (side step) or vertical (forward/backward) movement.

**Pull**

- **Forward locomotion**: A subtle pull with the left hand encourages the follower to step forward.
- **Horizontal locomotion**: A sideward pull indicates a lateral movement, inviting the follower to step to the side.

## Feet

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - BODY TOOL - FEET.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20BODY%20TOOL%20-%20FEET.png)

**Stepping**

- When the **lead steps**, it initiates a **weight transfer**, prompting the follower to shift their weight in response. This is the foundational mechanism for initiating movement and timing in Kizomba.

**Pressure**

- **Horizontal locomotion**: The lead’s feet can subtly guide or nudge the follower’s feet from side to side, influencing lateral steps.
- **Stop**: A firm or anchored pressure communicates a pause, halting movement or preparing for a change in direction.

# Steps

Traditionally, dance is taught using fundamental steps that embed various techniques within them. While effective, this approach can lead to the memorization of steps as rigid structures. The goal here is to **identify the technical components** behind each movement, so dancers can understand what causes a desired effect. This awareness can lead to **clearer, more intentional, and creative leading**, allowing dancers to break free from pre-established patterns.

A single dance step involves multiple techniques executed simultaneously through different body tools. By understanding the specific effects each body tool has on the follower, leads can enhance the clarity of their signals—making the dance more enjoyable, fluid, and easier for followers to interpret.

## Basic 2

- **Locomotion:** Horizontal motion

**Body Tools Involved:**

*Moving to the left*
- *Chest – Horizontal Locomotion*: Initiates and guides the overall side-to-side movement.
- *Right Arm – Pressure*: Supports the lead’s intention by gently guiding the follower rightward.
- *Right Arm – Steadiness*: Maintains consistent frame and chest connection, helping the follower stay aligned and responsive.

*Moving to the right*

## Basic 3

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Forward*
- *Chest - Forward locomotion*: push the follower back opening space for the lead to step forward.

*Stoping*
- *Chest - Disconnection*: As the lead slow down performing a marca causing the follower to stop.

*Moving Backward*
- *Chest - Disconnection*: The lead moves back creating space for the follower to step forward.
- *Right Hand Fingers - Pressure:* The lead can apply gentle pressure on the follower’s back using the fingers. This subtle cue invites the follower to step forward.
- *Right Hand Palm - Pressure:* By keep the arm in place, the follower will feel increased pressure on their back leading them to step forward.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the lead's right arm in place will also assist the follower to keep chest and connection and therefore move forward.

*Stoping*
- *Chest - Pressure*: As the lead slow down performing a marca causing the follower to stop.

## Estrela

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Forward, Angle, Backward

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Forward*: Same as Basic 3 moving forwards.

*Pivoting*:
- *Chest - Angle:* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Moving back*: Same as Basic 3 moving backwards.

## Vírgula

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Angle

**Body Tools Involved**

*Pivoting*:
- *Chest - Angle:* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Closing*: Same as Basic 2 moving to the right.

## Retrocesso

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Backward, Rotation, Rightward

**Body Tools Involved**

Consider the weight is already on the leads left leg.

*Pivoting*
- *Chest - Angle:* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Contratempo*
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* As the lead’s body shifts quickly to the left in a syncopated manner, the follower is naturally pushed to the right. This sudden lateral displacement acts as a physical cue, signalling the follower to match the syncopation by adjusting their timing and stepping more quickly.

## Men Saída

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace → Side to Side → Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Exiting the Lane*
- *Chest – Forward Side Locomotion*: The lead steps **diagonally forward to the left**, moving outside the follower’s lane. This **guides the follower backward** in response to the chest’s direction and movement.
- *Right Arm – Pressure*: A subtle and consistent pressure supports the chest lead, reinforcing the follower’s **backward step** and maintaining connection through the walk.

*Preparing to Reenter the Lane*
- *Chest – Forward Angled Locomotion*: As the lead prepares to re-enters the lane, the chest angles to the **right**, creating **dissociation** between the torso and legs.

*Reentering the Lane*
- *Left Thigh – Low Pressure:* Left lead's thigh establish contact with the follower’s right thigh, offering support and orientation as the lead transitions lanes, enhancing clarity in the redirection.
- *Right Thigh – High Pressure:* As the final action, a stronger pressure with the right thigh directs the follower to step laterally to their right (marca) to close the sequence and reestablish the embrace position.

## Woman Saída

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace → Side to Side → Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Back*
- *Chest - Low Pressure:* When the lead steps forward, their chest creates gentle pressure against the follower’s chest, causing the follower to step back. However, because the pressure remains low and sustained, it communicates a pause or stop, rather than continuous motion.
- *Thigh - Pressure:* The lead’s left thigh applies pressure to the follower’s right thigh, pushing it diagonally backward. This action effectively guides the follower off their lane.

*Exiting the line*
- *Right Arm - Pressure*: As the lead steps backward, pressure is increased on the follower’s back, signaling them to step forward. Since the follower has already been displaced from their lane by thigh pressure, this forward step places them into a Side-to-Side opposite position.
- *Chest - Angle*: As the lead takes a left step back, they angle their torso to the right towards the follower, creating dissociation between the upper and lower body. This angular cue causes the follower to also angle their bodies towards the lead position their right foot pointing toward the original lane, preparing for a return to it.

*Entering the Line*
- *Right Arm - Pressure*: The lead maintains arm pressure while taking another step backward, prompting the follower to step forward. Since the follower is already angled toward the line, this step naturally leads them to reenter the original lane.
- *Chest - Angle*: The lead readjusts their torso to a neutral position, which causes the follower to do the same, realigning both partners and completing the redirection back into the original lane.

*Closing*
- *Chest - Pressure*: As the lead performs a Marca, the increased chest pressure against the follower communicates a signal to stop, causing the follower to also perform a Marca.
