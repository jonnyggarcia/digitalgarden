# Framework

This is an attempt to dissect Kizomba with the intention of identifying its components so that we can explore each of them and better understand how to transmit the dance to another person. In no way am I trying to restrict or define what Kizomba is. I approach this as an observer of the dance, trying to understand what it is made of.

Here is a basic diagram representing the framework—the technical structure—of Kizomba. The cultural aspect of the dance is not contemplated in this diagram.

**Position** refers to how the dancers’ bodies relate to each other. Usually, the follower mirrors the lead. **Signals** are the information transmitted from the lead to the follower to indicate what is coming next. Through signals, the lead initiates movement, referred to here as **locomotion**.

Signals are conveyed using different parts of the body, which are referred to as **body tools** in this framework. These signals guide the follower into a certain **direction**, which is then followed by some form of locomotion. Another quality of a signal is its **intensity**, which influences the energy or emphasis of the movement.

In general, Kizomba is a circular dance. However, many steps are executed in short straight lines—for example, Basic 2 or Basic 3. If we imagine a Cartesian plane, like in math graphs, movement can happen along the **vertical axis (Y)** or the **horizontal axis (X)**. Signals can also communicate a **change in direction**, either through a stop or by adding an **angled step**.

# Position

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - FRAMEWORK - POSITION.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20FRAMEWORK%20-%20POSITION.png)

The basic position in Kizomba is the **embrace**, where the lead and follower face each other in a friendly, close hold. They can also be positioned **side by side**, facing the same direction or facing opposite directions.

The **perpendicular position** refers to an **L or T shape**, where the lead is usually facing the follower, but the follower is not directly facing the lead. This creates an angular relationship between their bodies.

A commonly used variation is the **shadow position**, where the lead stands slightly behind and to the left of the follower, with both facing the same direction. There are a few instances where the follower is positioned behind the lead, which I refer to as the **reverse shadow position**.

Finally, there are a few movements in which the lead and follower are **almost entirely disconnected**, with minimal physical contact or even momentary separation.

# Locomotion

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - FRAMEWORK - LOCOMOTION.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20FRAMEWORK%20-%20LOCOMOTION.png)

Kizomba is known as a walking dance. In this framework, movement—or the absence of it—is referred to as **locomotion**.

From the lead’s perspective, movement can occur **forward and backward** (along the **vertical axis**, or **Y**) and **side to side** (along the **horizontal axis**, or **X**). Diagonals are created by combining a vertical with a horizontal locomotion. Circular movements, on the other hand, are created by combining linear steps with **angled steps**. A series of consecutive angled steps can result in a circular pattern, as seen in movements like Corridinho. Effectively, every time an angle is added to a movement, a new plane of motion is created.

Lastly, the **absence of movement** is also part of this framework. **Stops**, such as in the movement **Marca**, are often used to **change direction** or to **establish connection** with the partner.

# Angle Step

![ART - DANCE - KIZOMBA - FRAMEWORK - ANGLE.png](/img/user/MEDIA/ART%20-%20DANCE%20-%20KIZOMBA%20-%20FRAMEWORK%20-%20ANGLE.png)

The angle step causes one of the partners to change direction. It can be performed connected with a partner, as in Vírgula, or disconnected as in the Rule of 3 or Woman Saída with opening.

Since an angle step creates a new Cartesian plane for movement, there are three possible directions that can be taken after the angle step: forward, backward, and sideways.

When leads perform an angled step, it can shift the follower either forward, backward or sideways. A 90-degree Vírgula results in a backward angled step for the follower, whereas a 90-degree Estrela creates a forward angled step.

From the lead’s perspective, a left forward angle—like in a 90-degree vírgula—is performed by pivoting the chest and stepping forward with the left leg. A backward left angle is similarly executed by stepping back with the left leg while pivoting the chest. However, there is a second way to perform a forward left angle, which involves stepping forward with the right foot. Due to the body’s configuration, it is not possible to perform a backward left angle while stepping with the right leg.

**Connected Backward Angle (follower)**

In order for the lead to perform a forward angled step from his perspective—like a vírgula, which results in a backward angled step for the follower—he needs to pivot his chest. This pivot creates pressure against the follower’s chest, prompting her to pivot as well. The steadiness of the right arm is essential for the follower to perceive the angled step, as it creates lateral pressure against her left ribs.

**Connected Forward Angle (follower)**

A forward angled step for the follower is a backward angled step for the lead. The Estrela is one of the fundamental movements that uses this angle. Because the angle is to the right, the lead needs to use their right fingers to apply pressure against the follower’s body. Combined with a steady right arm, this allows the follower to perceive the angled step when the lead pivots their chest. Since the angled step is backward from the lead’s perspective, it creates a slight chest disconnection, which is mitigated by the steadiness of the right arm. This arm pressure also helps draw the follower forward.

**Disconnected Forward Angle (follower)**

This angle can be seen when leads perform the Passeio. It is created by applying finger pressure with the lead’s right hand against the follower’s right ribs, combined with an opening of the right arm. Alternatively, it can also be accomplished by pressing against the left side of the follower’s body using the base of the lead’s right arm in a hinge-like motion.

Another interesting way to perform this angled step is through the use of the lead’s thigh. This can be seen in the Rule of 3, where the lead stays in place, or when performing the Woman Saída with an opening. Instead of using the hands, the lead uses their thigh against the follower’s thigh to create a redirection in movement by applying pressure.

**Disconnected Backward Angle (follower)**

This pivot is less organic because we don’t naturally tend to walk backward. You can see this in the Rule of 3, starting with the follower walking backward. The angled step is caused by the lead opening their right arm and moving their hand toward their own chest. This can be enhanced by adding pressure with the right fingers. This motion causes the lead’s right arm to apply pressure to the follower’s chest, which helps indicate the direction. The same effect can be achieved by using the base of the right hand to push against the follower’s ribs.

# Modules

# Steps

Traditionally, dance is taught using fundamental steps that embed various techniques within them. While effective, this approach can lead to the memorization of steps as rigid structures. The goal here is to **identify the technical components** behind each movement, so dancers can understand what causes a desired effect. This awareness can lead to **clearer, more intentional, and creative leading**, allowing dancers to break free from pre-established patterns.

A single dance step involves multiple techniques executed simultaneously through different body tools. By understanding the specific effects each body tool has on the follower, leads can enhance the clarity of their signals—making the dance more enjoyable, fluid, and easier for followers to interpret.

## Basic 3

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Forward*
- *Chest - Forward locomotion*: push the follower back opening space for the lead to step forward.

*Stoping*
- *Chest - Disconnection*: As the lead slow down performing a marca causing the follower to stop.

*Moving Backward*
- *Chest - Disconnection*: The lead moves back creating space for the follower to step forward.
- *Right Hand Fingers - Pressure:* The lead can apply gentle pressure on the follower’s back using the fingers. This subtle cue invites the follower to step forward.
- *Right Hand Palm - Pressure:* By keep the arm in place, the follower will feel increased pressure on their back leading them to step forward.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the lead's right arm in place will also assist the follower to keep chest and connection and therefore move forward.

*Stoping*
- *Chest - Pressure*: As the lead slow down performing a marca causing the follower to stop.

## Estrela

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Forward, Angle, Backward

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Forward*: Same as Basic 3 moving forwards.

*Pivoting*:
- *Chest - Angle (counter right backward angle):* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Moving back*: Same as Basic 3 moving backwards.

## Vírgula

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Angle

**Body Tools Involved**

*Pivoting*:
- *Chest - Angle (forward left angle):* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Closing*: Same as Basic 2 moving to the right.

## Retrocesso

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Angle, Horizontal locomotion with contratempo

**Body Tools Involved**

Consider the weight is already on the leads left leg.

*Pivoting*
- *Chest - Angle (counter backward right angle):* When the lead pivot's it causes the follower to also pivot.
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* Keeping the leads right hand in place will cause the followers to also pivot and maintain the chest connection.

*Contratempo*
- *Right Arm - Steadiness:* As the lead’s body shifts quickly to the left in a syncopated manner, the follower is naturally pushed to the right. This sudden lateral displacement acts as a physical cue, signalling the follower to match the syncopation by adjusting their timing and stepping more quickly.

## Men Saída

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace → Side to Side → Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Exiting the Lane*
- *Chest – Forward Side Locomotion*: The lead steps **diagonally forward to the left**, moving outside the follower’s lane. This **guides the follower backward** in response to the chest’s direction and movement.
- *Right Arm – Pressure*: A subtle and consistent pressure supports the chest lead, reinforcing the follower’s **backward step** and maintaining connection through the walk.

*Preparing to Reenter the Lane*
- *Chest – Forward Angled Locomotion*: As the lead prepares to re-enters the lane, the chest angles to the **right**, creating **dissociation** between the torso and legs.

*Reentering the Lane*
- *Left Thigh – Low Pressure:* Left lead's thigh establish contact with the follower’s right thigh, offering support and orientation as the lead transitions lanes, enhancing clarity in the redirection.
- *Right Thigh – High Pressure:* As the final action, a stronger pressure with the right thigh directs the follower to step laterally to their right (marca) to close the sequence and reestablish the embrace position.

## Woman Saída

**Step Overview**

- **Position:** Embrace → Side to Side → Embrace
- **Locomotion:** Vertical motion

**Body Tools Involved**

*Moving Back*
- *Chest - Low Pressure:* When the lead steps forward, their chest creates gentle pressure against the follower’s chest, causing the follower to step back. However, because the pressure remains low and sustained, it communicates a pause or stop, rather than continuous motion.
- *Thigh - Pressure:* The lead’s left thigh applies pressure to the follower’s right thigh, pushing it diagonally backward. This action effectively guides the follower off their lane.

*Exiting the line*
- *Right Arm - Pressure*: As the lead steps backward, pressure is increased on the follower’s back, signaling them to step forward. Since the follower has already been displaced from their lane by thigh pressure, this forward step places them into a Side-to-Side opposite position.
- *Chest - Angle*: As the lead takes a left step back, they angle their torso to the right towards the follower, creating dissociation between the upper and lower body. This angular cue causes the follower to also angle their bodies towards the lead position their right foot pointing toward the original lane, preparing for a return to it.

*Entering the Line*
- *Right Arm - Pressure*: The lead maintains arm pressure while taking another step backward, prompting the follower to step forward. Since the follower is already angled toward the line, this step naturally leads them to reenter the original lane.
- *Chest - Angle*: The lead readjusts their torso to a neutral position, which causes the follower to do the same, realigning both partners and completing the redirection back into the original lane.

*Closing*
- *Chest - Pressure*: As the lead performs a Marca, the increased chest pressure against the follower communicates a signal to stop, causing the follower to also perform a Marca.
