[Diamante](https://youtu.be/gQFzVeXrZfg?si=WSDv4ewGfgyCSnwA&t=1579)

**Diamante (dimond)** is a variation of [[Kiz - Basic 3\|Basic 3]] where the lead walks diagonally. After 3 steps, the lead reversed the direction in the opposite diagonal. Upon completion of 4 diagonal walks, the couple have walked in the shape of a diamond.

1. 3 steps forward in diagonal
2. balance and reverse to the opposite diagonal walking backwards
3. Marca (or do it again)

*Key elements of the move*
- Only step 3 to balance and change direction.
- Later on this key element will become the 3rd entry to [[Retrocesso\|Retrocesso]]
