**Context**: As the final artwork of this series, I contemplate what it truly means to be Canadian or Brazilian, and what defines one's nationality. I do not speak perfect English; I was not born in Canada; I don't fully comprehend Canadian culture; I don't share the same cultural background as most of my friends. I do not speak perfect Portuguese; I don't share many moments with my family and dearest friends; I don't eat Brazilian food as often; I don't live in Brazil. I speak Portuguese as much as I speak English. Still, I am Canadian and also Brazilian.
