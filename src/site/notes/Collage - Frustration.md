**Context:** This collage was a tentative to use abstraction. This talks about my frustration of not be able to sustain myself thru art. The person is immersed in art, but reaches out to numbers and letters, which is a reference of my full-time job as system developer for a bank. The letters F and E are the first 2 letters of my real name, which is only used at work. This collage is also part of the series Abstract.
