**Volta da Mulher** (follower going around something, in this case, the lead). This is a disconnected step where the lead stays in the same spot while the follower walks around them.

**Lead**
1. Perform a [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]]. When the lead brings the follower in by pulling with the left hand, the direction of the arm should be diagonal to the right, guiding the follower to the right side of the lead’s body. Then, the lead should place the follower's hand on their body.
2. While the follower is going around, the lead should feel their hand tracing the lead's body. The lead should continue transferring their weight from side to side, marking the beat.
3. Once the follower completes the lap, the lead should perform a Basic 2 to the right to reconnect.

**Follower**
1. The lead will perform a [[Kiz - Saudação\|Saudação]], causing the follower to step backward with the right foot, then collect (marca) the left foot.
2. The follower will take a step to the left as the lead indicates the direction to the left.
3. The lead will place the follower’s right hand on their body.
4. The follower continues walking around the lead, tracing the lead’s body with their right hand, until completing the lap.
5. The lead will reconnect by performing a Basic 2 to the left.

**Variation**

Instead of starting the move from the Saudação, the lead can initiate it from a [[Kiz - Woman Saída\|Woman Saída]].

*Key Elements of the Move*

- When the follower receives a signal, such as to walk forward, they should continue in that direction until the lead provides a different signal.
- The follower should trace the lead’s body so that the lead is aware of the follower’s position.
