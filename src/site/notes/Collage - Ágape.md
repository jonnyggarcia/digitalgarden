**Ágape**: term referring to unconditional love, "the highest form of love, charity and "the love of God for man and of man for God".

**Context:** An Asian woman saying thank you in ASL (American Sign Language) that is converted into a heart symbol. As per the title, this collage is about a love. This collage represents my experience of being in a relationship with a Deaf Japanese woman. Japanese people almost never use the expression I love you; they tend to express their love in different ways and in this particular case being grateful for the existence of the person in their lives. So, the word Thank You in ASL is converted to love.
