# Curriculum

The [[Kiz - Curriculum\|Curriculum]] is divided into modules, each containing 5 classes. The steps are organized to introduce fundamental concepts first, which form the foundation for more advanced techniques. The curriculum is designed with leads in mind, as followers are not required to memorize any footwork.

Every step presented in the Curriculum has a Portuguese name. Aside from the basic steps, all the names presented were coined by me to aid in memorization and to create distinctions among them. I have also divided all the moves into five broad categories. In the [[Kiz - Movement Dictionary\|Movement Dictionary]], you can find all moves categorized.

Each step has its own page with various pieces of information:

- Demonstration video
- English name
- Step-by-step description
- Essential aspects
- Catalog information

> [!danger] The pages for each step still under construction

# Catalog

Each move also has a code, such as **C***C*01.

- The **first letter** indicates the broad category of the move.
- The *second letter* indicates a subcategory of the move. This may be absent if there is no subcategory; for example, B01 (Basic Move, Cataloged Step 1).
- The two-digit number is a sequential number.
- The letters used are based on the names of the categories.

Sometimes you will find a code like this: FC04.*01*

- This indicates move FC04: Grounded Figure number 4, with the first entry.

Another code presented is FC04-*P*

- This indicates move FC04: Grounded Figure number 4, with trick P (puxada).

At the bottom of each page, you will find the catalog information:

- Movement Code.
- Connections: Other steps that are required to perform the step in question.
- Parent: The category to which the movement belongs.
