# Principles of Kizomba

In Kizomba, the following ideas can be taken as guiding principles. These are statements that explain what needs to be done under certain circumstances.

## Communication

*All moves, including Basic 1 and Basic 2, must be led.*

Followers should never rely on memorization to know what they are supposed to do. Even basic moves, such as Basic 2, need to be led with clear signals.

## Mind Reading

*Followers are not mind readers. If they are not doing what the lead intended, the lead must provide clearer signals.*

Telling a follower that they are not doing what they are supposed to won't help them improve. Explaining to a follower during a social setting why they made a mistake is not the right way to "correct" them. The lead needs to focus on improving their leading skills to ensure the follower receives clear signals and understands what needs to be done. Every attempt is an opportunity to refine the move for better execution next time.

## Transfer the Weight

*When taking a step, transfer your weight.*

In Kizomba, most moves require both leads and followers to transfer their weight. By fully committing the weight, only one leg remains free to take the next step. In the beginning, it is common for followers to perform spins without transferring their weight, which can cause disconnection between the couple. If this happens, the lead can adjust by performing a contratempo step. When a **marca** is performed, the next move will start with the same leg the previous move ended on. The lead must be clear about when a move is a **marca** and when it is a step.

## Take a Step

*Followers have legs, so they need to walk by themselves rather than being dragged by the lead.*

Many beginner followers struggle to differentiate when the lead is changing direction, causing the lead to compensate and drag them. For example, when the lead changes from Basic 3 moving forward to Basic 3 moving backward. It is the follower’s responsibility to notice the signals and intentions provided by the lead and follow them. Likewise, it is the lead's responsibility to give clear signals, direction, and intention. If the follower is not picking up on the signals, the lead needs to be clearer in their guidance. Followers can benefit from **[[Kizomba Exercises\|Acknowledgement]]** exercises, while leads can practice the **Placement** exercise to enhance the clarity of their intentions.

## Mirror the Lead

*The lead will initiate a move, and the follower must mirror what the lead is doing.*

When the lead performs a movement, the follower should do the opposite. For example, when the lead steps forward with their left foot, the follower should step back with their right foot. When the lead is performing the Rule of 3 by opening their chest to the left, the follower should open their chest to the right.

## Following is Your Only Job

*Followers should focus solely on physical listening.*

It is not the follower's responsibility to memorize footwork or identify the specific moves the lead is performing. Their only responsibility is to respond to the intention, signals, and direction provided by the lead.

## Where is the Weight?

*Leads are responsible for knowing where the follower’s weight is.*

Leads must be aware of where the follower is placing their weight. Certain moves, like leg fishing, can only be performed when the lead has a clear understanding of the follower’s weight transfer. The **Placement** exercise is a good practice to align the lead’s intention with their execution.

## You Are Where You’re Supposed to Be

*Wherever the lead has placed you is the right place to be.*

Followers should never second-guess whether they are in the right position. If they are in front of the lead, that is the correct place. If they are beside the lead, that is also correct. Followers are not responsible for trying to reconnect. Leads must be precise about where they are placing their followers. If the lead wants to reconnect chest-to-chest, they must guide the follower to be directly in front of them.

## Seek Connection

*When moving forward, seek connection with your partner.*

Whoever is moving forward should seek connection, especially with the thigh when performing disconnected steps. For example, it is the follower’s responsibility to seek thigh connection on the 3rd step of a Woman Saída.

## Follow Until It Changes

*Followers should continue following the last signal until it changes.*

The follower should keep following the last signal given and only stop when a new signal is provided. They will then follow the new signal until another is given. This is especially important for moves like "**[[Kiz - Volta da Mulher\|Volta da Mulher]]**" or "**Onde Você Pensa que Vai?**".
