**Context:** Each colours of the wall represents different realities, different dimensions. The woman tries to reach the man’s hand, but she is on the black dimension, while the man is on the red and blue dimension. They are not going to find each other. The fact that the woman is real, and the man is a cartoon also reinforce the idea of disconnection between them.
