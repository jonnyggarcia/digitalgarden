**Saída** (exit) refers to moving off the track. In the Man Saída, the lead steps out of the track and then returns.

From the follower's perspective, it consists of three steps backward followed by a Basic 2 (marca) to the left.

**Lead**
1. Give the intention to walk forward, but step diagonally to the left.
2. Step forward beside the follower with the right leg.
3. Take a step with the left leg, crossing in front of the right leg. Here is the beginning of the reconnection with the follower.
4. Step to the side with the right leg (Basic 2—don't forget to use your hands to guide the follower).
5. Close the left foot (marca).

When the couple is walking side by side, their torsos are slightly pivot towards each other (dissociated from the legs), but the steps are forward.

*Key elements of the move*
- Leads should give the same intention on step 1 as in Basic 3.
- Leads should direct the follower with their hands on step 4.
