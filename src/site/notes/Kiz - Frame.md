Both partners need to maintain a frame while dancing. The frame is essential for the lead to effectively guide the follower. Additionally, a follower without a frame will struggle to interpret the lead’s signals. In Kizomba, there is minimal upper body movement; therefore, the less the upper body moves, the clearer the signals will be for the follower.

**Leads**
- Frame is closely connected to posture. The lead should maintain a straight posture, even if their partner is significantly shorter.
- The lead’s chest and right arm are the primary sources of communication.
- In a chest-to-chest position, the follower is positioned between the lead’s chest and their right arm.
- The right arm is not meant to squeeze the follower; it rests firmly against the follower’s back without applying pressure.
- The inner part of the lead’s elbow should remain in contact with the side of the follower’s torso.
- The space created between the chest and right arm must remain consistent when performing movements that require a chest-to-chest connection. Any changes in the position of the right arm can cause the follower to misinterpret the lead’s intentions.
- The less experienced the follower, the tighter the frame should be to ensure clear signals and intentions, reducing potential confusion. However, this does not mean applying excessive pressure or squeezing the follower.
- The lead’s goal is to communicate intentions precisely and clearly through their frame.

Note: The position of the right arm will adjust when the lead performs certain steps.

**Followers**
- The follower’s left arm should rest against the lead’s back, but without squeezing it.
- The left arm should rest on top of the lead’s right arm.
- The follower is responsible for carrying the weight of their own arms, so the lead should not feel any weight on their right arm.
- The follower should also avoid squeezing the lead’s right arm against their side.
- The follower’s left arm serves as a source of information, especially when the lead is moving away from them.
- The follower’s goal is to be responsive to the lead’s intentions and signals.

Note: The position of the left arm will change when the lead performs certain steps.

**Drill: Holding the Pen**

By yourself, take a Kizomba stance and place a pen between your chest and your right arm (for the lead) or left arm (for the follower).

- The pressure applied should be as minimal as possible, with the pen almost falling.
- Your goal is not to drop the pen.
- Move freely, alternating direction and speed.
- Pay attention to the pressure exerted by the pen against your skin.
- The pressure should remain consistent. If you feel the pressure changing, it means you are moving your arm while you move.
- If the pen falls, it means the arm has moved.

Note: While doing this drill, remember to keep the weight on the balls of your feet.

*Key elements of the move*
