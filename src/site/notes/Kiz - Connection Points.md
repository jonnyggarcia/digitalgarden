Kizomba is a dance lead with the chest, hands, feet, and knees. The primary point of contact is chest to chest keep space between partners on the pelvic area.

The second point of contact is the right hand of the lead. It is placed on the centre of the follower's back.

The third point is the left hand where the elbow is pointing down.

Feet and knees connection will be discussed in another sections
