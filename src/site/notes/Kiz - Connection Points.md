Kizomba is a dance led using the chest, hands, feet, and knees. 

The **primary point** of contact is chest-to-chest, with space maintained between the partners in the pelvic area.

The **second point** of contact is the lead’s right hand, which is placed at the center of the follower’s back.

The **third point** of contact is the lead’s left hand, which holds the follower’s right hand. Both elbows should point downward. The lead can also place their hand against the left side of their chest.

The **follower’s left hand** is positioned above the lead’s right arm and should rest lightly on the lead’s upper back.

The follower should support the weight of their arms without pressing them against the lead.

The connection between the feet and knees will be discussed later.
