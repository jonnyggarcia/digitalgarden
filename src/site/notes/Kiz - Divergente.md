**Divergente** (divergent, as in a diverging lens shape) is a sequence of 4 [[Kiz - Corridinho\|Corridinho]]s in a row, alternating between forward and backward movements.

**Lead**
1. Perform left Corridinho forward.
2. After the 5th step (left leg), switch to right Corridinho backward, starting with the right leg.
3. After the 5th step (right leg), repeat the sequence.

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead should aim to maintain the shape of the Corridinhos.
- This move emphasizes the change in direction along a curve, similar to [[Kiz - Diamante\|Diamante]].
- Practice starting in both directions.
