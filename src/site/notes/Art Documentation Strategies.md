Since joining the [[Digital Collage#Collage in practice workshop\|Collage in Practice Workshop]], I've observed that many participants struggle with the administrative aspects of the practice, such as cataloging and documentation.

Documentation is already an integral part of my artistic practice, as detailed in the [[Module - Element of Practice\|Module - Element of Practice]]. The fundamental steps in my administrative work include:

- Naming the collage
- Adding my stamp with the date
- Backing up the original file to the cloud
- Exporting to JPG and saving on the cloud, iPad, and phone
- Publishing on Instagram
- Adding an entry to Obsidian
- Publishing it on my Digital Garden

# Finding a Collage

I understand that people may find these activities burdensome. That is when the book [[Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] can come in handy.

There's no way around it; these tasks may seem tedious or boring, but in the long run, they will significantly benefit you. When building my Digital Garden, I wanted a collage on each page. For the Reflections page, I knew the specific collage I wanted but couldn't recall its name or the year I made it. After sifting through about 50 collages, I realized that with only 500 pieces currently, finding something is manageable, but what about when I have 2000 or more? It will become impossible without a systematic approach.

To address this, I categorized my collages using descriptive hashtags, making it easy to search and locate them quickly.

Another unexpected advantage of this new process is that I can now observe how frequently certain elements appear in my work. For example:

- I have 28 analog collages.
- There are 11 collages featuring animals.
- There are 10 collages about ASL (American Sign Language).
- I have 93 collages featuring hands.
- I have 102 collages that is blueish.

Another benefit of this system is the ability to correlate collages created at completely different times, possibly ones that I don't remember. I believe this can aid in assembling a body of work focused on a specific theme.

# Documentation

> [!quote] "changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if youâ€™re willing to stick with them for years" - Atomic Habits, James Clear

Art evokes questions, and having a comprehensive record of your work is crucial. Consider questions like:

- What materials were used?
- What are the sources of the materials?
- What is the size?
- What is the medium?
- When was it made?
- What is it about?
- Where was it made?
- What were the inspirations for it?

The relevance of specific questions depends on the person asking and the intended purpose. However, when dealing with a substantial body of work, if tasked with providing information about a collage created ten years ago, I can guarantee you won't recall half of the questions I mentioned earlier.

To tackle the daunting task of documentation, create a one-page document listing all the important aspects you want to document. Save it as a template, make a copy for each new collage, and answer the questions.

If you prefer an analog approach, you can use index cards. However, I do not recommend using analog methods because they introduce friction, making the system more challenging to use.

- You won't be able to search through them automatically.
- The physical act of writing a new card with all the questions for each new collage adds extra work.

In my case, I have one file for each collage I've made, resulting in 500+ files on my computer.

# Habit

You might be telling yourself that everything I've said so far is kind of obvious, and the problem is you lack the motivation, organization, or you're just feeling lazy.

Those are all valid points. Yes, the system is obvious. Why create something complicated for a task that is already painful to do? Now the question is, how do you address the issues of motivation, laziness, or disorganization? **MAKE IT SIMPLE, EASY, AND ATTRACTIVE**

I maintain a comprehensive checklist for tasks to complete once a collage is finished. Here are some of the items on the list:

- Did I name it?
- Did I add my stamp and fill out the date?
- Did I back up the file?
- Did I store the JPG version?
- Did I publish it to Instagram?
- Did I catalog it in Obsidian?
- Did I publish it to my Digital Garden?

Consider creating your own version of the checklist, tailored to the tasks that should be accomplished when completing a collage. If you work on a computer, print it prominently with big, bold letters and attach it near the exit door in your studio. This way, every time you leave the studio, you'll be reminded to complete these essential tasks.

While it might seem like additional work, going through 500 collages to find one can be more infuriating than spending an extra 5 minutes on documentation.

For those inclined towards technology (I can assist you with that), you can create a Google Form and bookmark it. When cataloging a new collage, simply go to your computer, open your browser, and click on the saved link. A form is much more user-friendly than a spreadsheet, and once you submit your answers, it will automatically be stored as a new record in a spreadsheet on your Google Drive. Simple, easy, and efficient.

The organizational tool I use is called [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]], a note-taking app on steroids. Often marketed as a second brain. If you're curious, please let me know, and I can assist you with it.

# Accessibility

Consider these factors when creating your system:

- Ensure you have a backup, preferably stored online.
- Make information available online for easy access across devices.
- Ensure easy retrieval of information, for example, using an Excel spreadsheet you can apply filters.
- Tailor the system to your needs for maximum effectiveness.
