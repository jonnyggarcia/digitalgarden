**[Enraged](https://www.instagram.com/p/DL2og95xSR9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)**: Made furious by something; filled with extreme anger.

Enraged examines the consuming power of emotion as a driving force in our lives. In moments of fury, perception narrows to red; a visceral state that is both destructive and disruptive.
