# Summary

Atomic Habit by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) is about changing of habits or developing new ones. He proposes a framework consisted of 4 laws that can be used to achieve significant changes in our lives. The book has many anecdotes from different fields such as sports and business. The goal is to find simple and easy things that lead to huge impact once it accumulates. The book is described as manual/framework of how to apply changes to our lives to harness transformative changes.

changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. — location: 155 

</div></div>


# Habits

A habit is something that is done over and over, usually automatically. Some habits are good ones, whereas other ones are no so good.

Clear started a blog out of his habit of writing and that eventually lead him to thousand subscribers. That remind me about the book [[Show your Work\|Show your Work]] where we should share our work instead of marketing ourselves, and eventually people will find us.

Dave Brailsford is cyclist coach that got hired and change the history of the British cycling team. The British team in 110 years never won the Tour de France, which is the most important event in the category. With the changes proposed by Brailsford in ten years, from 2007 to 2017, the team won 178 world championships, 6 olympic medals in the olympics, and 5 Tour de France, which is considered the most successful run in cycling history. What he did was to break down every single thing about cycling and look to improve by 1% each. When all those changes were put in place, it results in a fenomenal change.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” — location: 223 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable — location: 249 

</div></div>


There is a statistic, which I have no clue how to calculate, that if you improve 1% everyday, in the the end of year you are 37 times better than when you started. This remind about [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] of how each work informs what needs to be worked on in the next piece.

# The Enemy

The problem with habits is that is hard and the improvements takes time to manifest. In order to intellectually prove that you, if a plane leaves the LAX airport and adjust the corse by **only** 3.5% it will land in Washington, D.C. instead of New York.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. — location: 266 

</div></div>


The goal is to make small change that will lead to different behaviour. Everyone wants to achieve something, but in order to get there it is required to make adjustments as we go, therefore the journey is what matter and the result is just a consequence.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. — location: 280 

</div></div>


A parallel with interest compounds is drawn where the outcome is the result of compound interest, which could be positive or negative. Everything can be benefit from that. The more you help people, the more you can find people willing to help you. On the other side of the spectrum, if you constantly have negative thoughts about yourself, it is likely that you see life and things that happen you through the same lenses.

There was one day that I attended a dance party. My first 4 dances were horrible and the fact that i just started dance about 2 months prior, destroyed my confidence. That night I did not dance with other people.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU — location: 292 

</div></div>


# Results


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. — location: 318 

</div></div>


We all want the result, but we don't commit to the changes. People make a change and fail to keep doing it because no result or progress is evident. There is no work around, we need to stick to the changes until the result finally become visible. This is called the **Plateau of Latent Potencial**.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. — location: 327 

</div></div>


The funny thing is people never realized the effort you put towards something, but when the change happens, they see it as an overnight change. That is one of the reasons i believe people under appreciate the artist, they don't see the process behind it.

# System

What we want to achieve is our goal, but it won't happening without meaningful and intensional actions, that is the process, and it should be our focus. Think about the goal as the direction you have to take, your end goal, your destination. The process is the actions you take to get there. What way should you take to get where you want?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD — location: 351 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. — location: 358 

</div></div>


The reason people fail to achieve their goal is because the process is not working properly. It requires to analise and make alterations as we go. The mentality should be about what we can do now, rather what we want to achieve. Our commitment the process will decide the end result.

That reminds me again about [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]] where it mentions that as soon the artist stroke the canvas for the first time, it will decide how it will look like in the end. that is because it is a chain reaction. The first stroke will lead to the next one, that is limited by the current one.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. — location: 388 

</div></div>


# Identity

In order to make changes we need to focus on what needs to be changed and how to change them. For that there are 3 layers:

- Outcome: this is what you get out of it
- Process: this is what you do.
- Identity: this is what you believe.

Many times people struggle to make changes because they are sole based on the outcome they want to achieve. That can be a daunting task. What Clears propose is that we should make changes based on identity. It is about who you are and who you want to be. In the book he mentioned about a person offering a cigaret to someone. They can answer: "I quiet", or "I am not a smoker". This is a change in their identity, if i am not smoker, there is no reason to accept a cigaret, however if quit, you may fall short.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes. — location: 458 

</div></div>


Everything we do have a belief behind, and most of the time we are not really aware of it. The goal is to identify that and change it. That also include the bad habits, what is the second gain of our bad habits?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. — location: 466 

</div></div>


People will always be motivated to do things that bring them pride. So when people start to make changes, they fall short because it is not connected to their identity. We can always change our goals into an identity:

- I want to read more → I want to be a reader.
- I want to write more → I want to become a writer.
- I want to exercise more → I want to live healthier

The beliefs we have are also hindering our abilities to move forward. How many people do you know says:

- I am terrible at names
- I am terrible at directions

Those are beliefs that can be changed, but the person see themselves as that, so it will be almost impossible to change them because THEY ARE terrible at X.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. — location: 510 

</div></div>


Changes are hard because confront our inner values and beliefs, however if we want to become the best version of ourselves, we need to constantly adjust our identity.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. — location: 518 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” — location: 521 

</div></div>


Every time someone forget's somebody's name, they proof to themselves that they are bad at remembering names. That will lead to the identity of being horrible about names. Every time I make art I reinforce that I am an artist. So, identities are not something rigid and inflexible; they are just accumulation of "proofs".

When I started coaching trampoline, at the end of one of my classes my boss asked me what are the names of the children that attend it. I draw a blank and look stupid for now knowing. Then she asked me to try remember at least one name per class. Guess what, I started putting effort to remember their names, and in just a few classes I had memorized all the names. Despite the good intentions of my boss I felt that I was doing my best at work, so that prompt me change ASAP.

# Action


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself. — location: 533 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. — location: 542 

</div></div>


Who do you want to be? What those people do, that you can do right now? Once you start doing it over and over, you will become what you want. Once you accumulate small wins you have proof that you are that thing, and leads you be have a new identity.

When I visited Tokyo in 2019, I attended a Collage Exhibition called the Miracle of Silence by Toshiko Okanoue. As soon as I got back to my hotel room I pull out my iPAD and start collaging. A collagist do collage, so I did one. For the next several months I did collages about any ideas I had. I was not caring about the results, I wanted to do it! I was obsessed to explore all the possibilities. Eventually people start to complement my art, and that made confident about what I do. For your amusement, my first work and the work I work I considered my best.

Questions to ask yourself:

- What do you want to stand for?
- What are your principles and values?
- Who do you wish to become?

What small steps you can take to reinforce those identities?

Every time you are about to eat something and your goals is to be a health person, ask yourself: What would a healthy person do?

feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. — location: 568 

</div></div>


# Habit formation


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. — location: 612 

</div></div>


When we have no reference about a certain thing we may do good or bad. Those will be remember later and will help you decide how to proceed in a simular situation. If you it was bad you will do something differently, but if it was good, you will tend to repeat.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. — location: 621 

</div></div>


According to behavioural scientist Jason Hreha: “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

The more familiarity you have a situation the more you will automatically respond to it based on your previous encounters. Without active thinking about, you are predicting what should do that will lead to the best outcome possible. Once this decision is automatic we free our mental energy which become available to something else. If you have good habits stablished, your mental energy will be available to focus on whatever you want. In that sense a habit leads to freedom.

Habits are formed based on 4 simple steps:

- Cue: the trigger that makes you do something.
- Craving: what changes you want to happen? If you are hungry, you want to feel satisfied; eating is just what you do to change what you feel (response).
- Response: this is what you do to change your craving.
- Reward: this is what satisfy your craving.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. — location: 664 

</div></div>


Any stimuli we received can potentially trigger a habit, they need to be interpreted. The craving is what you want to change in the current moment; I want to feel warmer, so you put a jacket on, that is your response, and as you feel better and warmer, you get your reward. Since you learned that put a jacket made you feel warmer, this will help you decide what to do in the future when confronted with a similar situation.

When the response requires more energy than you have available or willing to expend, most likely you will not do anything.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. — location: 690 

</div></div>


# Awareness


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — location: 839 

</div></div>


Japan implemented a system called Pointing-and-Calling for the train operators, which basically request someone to say something out-loud as they executed. This technique reduces mistakes because force people to pay attention on what they are doing. It seems silly but it reduced mistakes by 85% and accidents by 30%. New York City adopted a similar technique and the incorrectly berthed subways fell by 57%. The demand to use multiple parts of their body, eyes, mouth, fingers, and ears increase the change to notice something wrong. Just like mentioned in the book, when I leave a place I speak out-loud what I need with me: cellphone, wallet, keys, and etc.

That techniques reveals that we fail at doing something due to the lack of awareness. So if you want to change something, the first step is to realize what are you doing. As an exercise the book propose to make a **Habit Scorecard**:

- Make a list of your daily habits (p. 64):
	- Wake up
	- Turn off alarm
	- Check my phone
	- Go to the bathroom
	- Weigh myself
	- Take a shower
	- Brush my teeth
	- Floss my teeth
	- Put on deodorant
	- Hang up towel to dry
	- Get dressed
	- Make a cup of tea
- Beside of each habit, add + sign for a positive habit, add - for a negative habit, and = for a neutral habit (p. 65).
	- Wake up =
	- Turn off alarm =
	- Check my phone –
	- Go to the bathroom =
	- Weigh myself +
	- Take a shower +
	- Brush my teeth +
	- Floss my teeth +
	- Put on deodorant +
	- Hang up towel to dry =
	- Get dressed =
	- Make a cup of tea +

To decide which one is good (+), neutral (=), or bad (-), ask yourself: Which ones help you become who you want to be? How they are benefiting you in the long run?

If you are not sure, say out-loud what are the consequences of doing certaing behaviour. It will make more real and easier to indentify the bad one.

# Making Changes

A research has identified that the more precise you describe something it is more likely that you will do it. They nominate this process as **Implementation Intention**. Describe when and how you will do something.

“During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. — location: 935 

</div></div>


Sometimes what is stoping you to start doing something is lack of awareness or clarity of how and when to do something. If you have a plan, your changes to do something will be higher.

==***I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]***==

Behaviour is like link in a chain. One thing leads to another. We can use this principle to our advantage. Identify some habits you already to and add something as next step after it. This is called **Habit Stacking**.

***==After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]==***

This is very similar to a hypnotic triggers: When i snap my fingers, you will laugh because it is very funny.

# Environment

The environment greatly influences your habits. Depending on where you are, you can trigger different habits. This can be demonstrate via the equation.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). — location: 1064 

</div></div>


Out vision plays an important part in our behaviour. In fact, we have about 11 million sensory receptors, and 10 out of those 11 million is dedicated to vision. So visual queues are strongly responsible to trigger a habits. So by make something more visible we enhance the chances to do something. If you want to drink more water, put bottle of water in every room. On the other hand, if you want to stop doing something, you can make the queue invisible. If you want to not look at your phone that often, put it away in another room.

People tend to think we need a lot of will power to stick with good habits and avoid temptation. However, research prove that people that have good habits are just better at avoid temptation. So make the good one visible and hide the temptations.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships — location: 1129 

</div></div>


My good friend Maul once commented the dynamic change in the house of some relatives. The living room didn't have a television, so people talk to each other. Once they add a television, people stop talking and spend more time watching tv. Similarly, when I moved to my current place i decide to not have a TV on the living room, because that is a place for human interaction.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another — location: 1154 

</div></div>


A good practice is to create a single association with a specific habit. Spending lots of time watching television in the bedroom creates a strong association with the TV, perhaps it will be more difficult to fall sleep. In fact, a research request a people to only go to bed when they are tired, and if they are not able to sleep they must leave bedroom. Overtime they start to fall sleep easily due to the association between bed and sleep.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Habits thrive under predictable circumstances — location: 1163 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable. — location: 1165 

</div></div>


# Temptations & Motivation

People can change their habits, but that does not mean they will forget about it. The key to success is to be disciplined and to make it easier, we should design our environment to make it easier. That is why it is hard to resist temptation; once you know what reward you can get, you will tend to fall short.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. — location: 1218 

</div></div>


If a cue is what triggers a habit, we can make it more visible and super charged in order to make something happen. The greater the stimuli, the greater the effort applied.

Currently the great majority of food available is designed to have contrast, for example pop corn that is salty and sweet at the same time. This contrast keep the eating experience novel, which become addictive. This is super charged stimuli.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. — location: 1284 

</div></div>


Addictive things exaggerated something to rise desire (cue): porn, beauty standards, constant likes that delivers more praises than we can get in a life-time. This causes a dopamine spike in our brains.

A study conducted by neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner in 1954 revealed that by suppressing dopamine rats lost the desire to be alive. They wouldn't eat or procreated, they didn't crave anything. In few days they all died. Dopamine is not only associated with pleasure. It plays a fundamental role in motivation, learning and memory, as well in voluntary movement. When our brains predict that something will lead us to a reward that is a spike in dopamine.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. — location: 1339 

</div></div>


Our brain's reward system is activated when we receive one, or when we predict that we will receive a reward. So the anticipation can be as rewarding as the thing in itself. That is why when our emotions are triggered, it win even when the logical explanation is way more reasonable.

Knowing that we are drove by reward, we can attach something we need to do to something we must do. I hate doing dishes, so I have a bad habit to accumulate a pile. In order to motivate me to clean it, I start listing to audio book while doing the dishes. Funny enough, I become more and more excited as the pile grow. Side note: after reading this book, I am making changes to not accumulate dishes.

**Variable reward** is the concept to provide reward in a non predictable order. Slots machines are the perfect example. The players know they could win the next time, but they might not. The unknow keep them addicted to it. What happens the variance in the reward create the greatest spike in dopamine, and makes habit formation faster.

***==The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]==***

Doesn't it sounds like gamefication?

When comes to motivation it is important to work on tasks that proves to be a challenge. If they are too easy, you most likely lose interest. It they are too difficult, you give up. When a task challenging but just enough, that keeps you going. This is called the **Goldilocks Rule**


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. — location: 2781 

</div></div>


# Influences

Here is a very interesting story. In 1965, Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian man, applied his theory of producing a genius. He decide to teach 3 sisters how to play chess. Everything was about chess. The kids spent hours playing together, and they were always complimented for their achievements. The environment was designed to enhance anything related to chess. The culture was not to push or force, but to motivate and reward. As a consequence, Sofia, which was the middle child, was the world champion by the age of 14 and become a grandmaster few years later. Judith, the youngest, she became a grande master at the age of 15, they youngest grandmaster of all times. She was the number one female chess player for 27 years. This was only possible due to intentional and intrinsic habit design.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large. — location: 1444

As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.” — location: 1449 

</div></div>


Beside genetics, we are who we are due to our environment and the people around us. Our habits are inherited from the people around us. The closer we are to someone it is more likely that we will imitate them. Having that in mind, a good strategy is surround yourself with people that are what you aspire to become. Those people are the embodiment of the identity you want for yourself. That remind me of the comcept of a Scenius from [[Show your Work\|Show your Work]]:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“scenius.” Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.” — location: 53

We are designed to be part of a group. A series of study conduct in 1950 by psychologist Solomon Asch demonstrate that people conform with lies due to peer pressure and self-doubt. In the study a card with different lines with different lengths are presented. Another card display a single line. the participants were tasked to identify what lines match between the cards. The majority of people were instructed to choose the line A as match for the line on the first card. The greater the number of people who purposely choose the wrong line the higher the chance that a subject not aware of it will comply with the incorrect statement. Nearly 75% of people went along.

When we want something, what do we do? We check reviews done by other people. We have a tendency to want to belong even though we may be wrong. This remind me of how normal and sane people get involved with cults. If you are curious check the documentary [The Vow about NXIVM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vow_(TV_series)>).

When come to the people who influence us, there are 3 groups:

- The closest: your family and friends.
- The mass: the hive of nobodies like us.
- The powerful: the stars, the richest, and influencers.

This is behave rooted historically in the fact that the more power you have the more chances and opportunities will be presented to you. So we like to be among the top, and do things to avoid lower our status.

# Craving

Behind craves there is a fundamental basic truth. Here are some of them:

- Conserve energy
- Obtain food an water
- Find love
- Reproduction
- Connection and belonging
- Social acceptance
- Reduce uncertainty
- Achieve status and prestige
- I would add shelter to this list
- Minimum effort possible

A smoker was not born with desire to smoke, but the act of doing it reduces anxiety; it changes the state you are. By the history of past events, the smoker predicts what is the best in order to relieve the anxiety. So habits are solutions for current situations learned over time. What motivates you to act is the desire to change your current state.

# Reframing

We can see things as half empty or half full. The moment we see something as a problem or a chore, it becomes just like it.

> [!quote] "If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.” - Abraham Maslow

In the book there is an anecdote about someone asking a person in a wheelchair if it was difficult to be confined. The answer was unexpected, the person was free and not confined, because without the wheelchair they will bed bound.

How can you change your vocabulary to see things in a new perspective? How can you reframe your habits to highlight their benefits?

# Action

Motivation is key to adhere to a habit. To potencialize a new habit associate it to something you enjoy. No matter what you need to do something. Changes can only happen through action.

Funny enough there is a story about a photography class where the teacher divided the class in two groups. The final grade will be based on quantity of pictures taken for group 1, and for group 2 the the grade will be based on the quality of a picture, even if it is a single picture. In the end, group 1 had group had several pictures, whereas group 2 none because they spend time debating what would be a perfect picture.

What is interesting about this story is that by taking several pictures the students were able to practice and improve. Moreover every new picture gives the impression that they were making progress.

The book refers to the concept of Motion and Action. When you are planning something, studying about it, you are in motion, however that will not generate any results. If you want to write an article, and you are doing the research and reading several references, that is motion. The article will only exist after you take action to actually write it. Motion is good as direction, the action is what makes the difference. That resonates with the idea to look at the process and not the goal.

In order to form a habit, you need to take action over and over again. Does not matter for how long you are doing something, what matter is how ofter you do it.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” — location: 1735 

</div></div>


Action does require effort, and as good human beings as we all are, we like to be comfortable and apply the least amount of effort as possible. That is the **Law of Least Effort**. No one wants the habit itself, we want what it delivers. The habit is just a method to solve an issue, so we want our issues solved. That bring us to strategy to make things are easy as possible, so you will do what needs to be done even when you don't feel like it.

The times you don't do are prejudicial in the long run. The secret is to always do despite not wanting it. So your identity needs to be alined and effort requires should be easy and attractive to encourage you to take action.

Don't try to fight the difficulties, find way around them. To make something easier you have to reduce the friction to take actions. As mentioned before, designing you environment can help a lot to spring you into actions. Want to drink more water, spread as many water bottle possibles around the house, so you don't have friction to stand up and walk to the kitchen. Another important thing to consider is where you do things. Find places to do what needs to be done that is close your current routine. If the gyn is far and close to nowhere, most likely you won't go. however if it is between you work and home, there is higher change that you end up going to the gyn.

On the other side of the spectrum you can increase friction to make something harder to do. Do you want to stop watching tv, unplug it and ask someone to hide the remote. If you want to take it further, remove the batteries and store than in the farthest place possible. Now, when you want to watch tv you going to spend a lot of energy.

Earlier I mentioned that I am doing changes regarding my bad habit of cleaning the dishes. Before I used to accumulate piles of dishes, then motivate myself to clean them by listening to audio books. However I do not do this any longer. Since I finished this book, no piles of dishes have been formed. I applied 2 strategies: Every time I finish eat and put a plate on the sync, i have to clean it. I know it sounds basic and simple, but before I used to think that I rather do something more enjoyable and leave the dishes for after. The second strategy that help with the mindset is called Resetting the Room.

Oswald Nuckols always want to have the environment ready to be used, so every time he finishes an activity, he resets it to the original configuration; resetting the room.

A family I know always prepared the table for breakfast before going to bed. When they wakeup next day, all the utensil, dishes, cutlery are ready to be used, they only have to serve the food.

Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. — location: 1925

Habits work like a link in chain. Action X leads to action Y.

If we want to use the least amount of effort possible, make you habits easy. Meditating for 1 hours seems a doubting task, but doing it for only 1 minute is much easier. It does sound stupid to meditate for one minute, but doing that is better than nothing. Once you do for 1 minute for several days, perhaps you can do for 5 minutes, and then 10 minutes, and so one. The key point is not let the activity become an issue.

I used to be a trampoline athlete. One of the habits the coach applied when we were learning a new skill was to stop when it was good enough for the day. We were not chasing perfection, just the action to improve a little and stop before it becomes a burden.

This ideia to reduce something a bare minimum to make it easier is called **Two-Minute Rule**. The goal is to reinforce the identity we aspire to be.

Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. — location: 2044

Another strategy to make things harder is called a **Commitment Device**. Do want to gamble any more? Voluntary request to add your name to the banned list. Want to stop using social media, set up the max limit time you can use the software per day. The harder it is do something, the more likely you won't do it.

# Small Victories

As mentioned at begging the problem with action when comes to habits, usually it takes time to see the results. This is called a **delayed-return environment.** We do many things before we see any outcome. Only in the last 500 years, which is nothing in evolution terms, we shifted to live our lives in a delayed-return environment. This presents a challenge. Smoke grants instant gratification and delay the consequences. So question yourself if the instant pleasure and rewards align with your long-term goals and identity.

There is no work around, eventually you need to ignore the instant reward in favor of a delayed one. Knowing that, embed bits of immediate pleasure in the things you need to do; like me listening to audio book while doing the dishes. Also you can add a little pain to stop the habits you don't want.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. — location: 2284 

</div></div>


To make habit stick, you need to feel a little progress or success. That is sign that you precious effort payed off. A feel strategy can be applied to give you the feeling of progression. If you want to save money, you could open a saving accounts and name it as something you want like a Leather Jacket. Every time you make a contribution, you visually see the amount increasing and therefore getting closer to what you want. That is an immediate reinforcement.

Another interesting strategy presented is the paper clip. Get 2 bowls fill one with paper clips, or ay small objects. Every time you do something positive towards you habit, move the object to the other bowl. It will be visually satisfying once you have more on the 2nd bowl in comparison to the 1st one. Need to make lots of phone calls for work, track you progress one paper clip at time.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. — location: 2378 

</div></div>


# Tracking

Studies suggest that people who track things tends to be more successful at doing something towards their goals. Tracking weight, calories. By tracking, like the paper clip, you are honest with yourself. We have a tendency of holding distorted views about our own behaviour.

Here are some benefits of tracking:

- It become obvious: you have evidence of changes.
- It is attractive: you have evidence of progress.
- It is satisfying: it feels good to see changes and progress, and therefore more likely to continue.

Tracking habits is to pay attention at the process, which is fundamental.

The downside of tracking, it creates extra work. For some people that becomes a friction. If you can automate as much as possible or make it as easy as possible, it is likely that you will do it.

It is very important to mention that what we measure, or track, is what we want to optimize. By choosing the wrong measurement, we emphasize the wrong behaviour. Measurement is about adding guidance and help to see the big picture. It should not be end goal.

# Breaking the Habit

We all fall short and don't do what we supposed to do. Skip a diet, leave the dishes for tomorrow and so on. That is ok, but when that becomes normality, then we have an issue. If you can, never missed something twice. Skipped the gyn today? fine, but don't miss it tomorrow. What a health and atlethic person will do?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. — location: 2421 

</div></div>


It hurts more to miss than to actually do it. Here is a justification why it is really bad to miss doing what you need to do:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” — location: 2427 

</div></div>


The more imminent the punishment for something, the higher the chances you won't do it. If a punishment is painful enough and really enforced, you won't do it. A way to apply that to our lives it a **habit contract**.

Another anecdote. Bryan Harris wants to lose weight. So he made a habit contract with his wife and couch. If he did not write down all the food he consumed or did not weight himself, he would have to dress up each workday and Sunday for the rest of the quarter, plus he will give 200 dollars to his coach. They all signed the contract. Eventually he increased the conditions and obligations of it.

The stakes were real! Guess what, he lose all the weight he wanted.

# Pick your battles

We are born with a genetic code that will help or hinders us depending on the circumstance. Usually people that are the on the top of any sports are competent but also having genetic disposition to be good at their activity. Michael Phelps, one of the most successfull smiwers in history, has a good build for swimming. He has relatively short legs for his height and a very long torso. He most likely won't be as successful as if he was a runner, who require long legs.

Genes inform what areas you are more likely to be better at, but that they don't determine your destiny.

The personality analysis called Big Five, is the most scientifically relevant. There are five items:

- Openness to experience: curious and inventive < - > cautious and consistent.
- Conscientiousness: organized and efficient < - > easygoing and spontaneous.
- Extroversion: outgoing and energetic < - > solitary and reserved.
- Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate < - > challenging and detached.
- Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive < - > confident, calm, and stable

All those can be tracked from birth. For example, extroversion was measured based on the reaction of babies when a loud noise is played. Do they toward the noise or away from it? As the study follow those babies along their lives, the ones who turned toward the noise tend to become more extroverts, and the ones who turned away were more likely to be introverts.

The point is, pick your battles, If you choose something that you are not predispose to, most likely it will be hard. But also the things you are predisposed to, will be easier.

How do we identify what i'm more predisposed? Ask yourself the following questions:

**What feels like fun for me, but work to others?** The things that are less painful to you are the ones you are more likely to be build to better at.

**What makes me lose track of time?**

**Where do I get greater returns than the average person?**

**What comes naturally to me?**

Thos question can help you identify the things that most likely are easier for your. But for the ones that are hard, you can be good at them by being different.

# Good Habits


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death.

Having good habits will improve your life in the long-run. In the short-run, when you spend less time and energy doing trivial things, the more you can allocate yourself to do things that really matters.

Having good habits, that can lead to stagnation. It is proved that once mastering has been achieved there is a slightly decrease in performance. So keep the challenge enough task alive.

Master a skill is about breaking it down and improve each part consistently until it becomes internalized.

Remember to go back and make analysis and reviews. That will make you aware and possibly help you tailor your actions and find ways for further improvements.

The **Decision Journal**, is a place to keep all the important decision you make. They provide context for their decided course of actions, and later if they were correct or not. Upon review it, you can learn from yourself.

Beliefs are the key to change, but at the same time having a single belief define you, will hinder your ability to adapt. I know a person who struggled to retire for 8 years, just because their job was who they are. Be aware of how you frame your beliefs. Being an athlete is way more restrict than being someone who is mentally though and loves physical challenge.

Habits are good, but don't let yourself to be stuck in previous ways of thinking and acting.

The key for improvement is to be 1% better a thousand times. Progress by committing yourself to small and sustainable improvements.

Happiness is the absence of desire. If there is no desire, there is no need for a change. Achievement and pleasure are about job and satisfaction, those are the craves we want to change. We tend to pursue the idea of pleasure. As Lacan says, the object of desire.

Achieving peace is about not letting your observation into problems. If you have not desire to take action on your observations, you are at peace.

When the reason is bigger than the obstacles, you will find a way.

> [!quote] He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. - Friedrich Nietzsche

Curiosity is better than being smart. Being curious is to act, and action leads to change.

Emotions drive behaviour. When people have damage to emotional centres of the brain they won't act, and therefore won't make changes. Rationality comes after being emotional, that is product of evolution. That is why fears overpower logic. This is called System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) and System 2 (rational analysis). Data won't convince people, emotion will.

When we suffer we want to change what cause us pain.

When we ignoring a desire, we don't satisfy the craving. That is why we fail to resit them. The solution is to change the crave and not ignore it.

Expectation will define your satisfaction. The higher the expectation the higher is the pain.

Lets make break for a really funny passage:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

The Laws of behaviour changes are:

- **1st Law: Make it obvious** (cue)
- **2nd Law: Make it attractive** (craving)
- **3rd Law: Make it easy** (response)
- **4th Law: Make it satisfying** (reward)

Those same Laws can be inverted as:

- **Inversion of 1st law: Make it invisible** (cue)
- **Inversion of 2nd law: Make it unattractive** (craving)
- **Inversion of 3rd law: Make it difficult** (response)
- **Inversion of 4th law: Make it unsatisfying** (reward)

## 1st Law: Make it obvious

Anne Thorndike had a great solution of how to improve the habits of all visitors and staff of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and it didn't require to request them to make any changes or even talking to them.

The redesign the cafeteria and conduct a 6 months study. They add water bottles to the current refrigerators, and on top of that they spread bottle of waters next to all food station on the room. In 3 months the selling of soda dropped by 11.4% where as water increased by 25.8%.

1. Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
2. Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
3. Use habit stacking: “After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
4. Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

## 2nd Law: Make it attractive

Ronan Byrne applied his knowledge of engineering by hacking his stationary bike to his laptop and television. He loved Netflix but could only watch it if he was cycling at a certain speed or faster, if he stops or reduce the speed, the show is paused.

> [!quote] Eliminating obesity one Netflix binge at a time. - Ronan Byrne

1. Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
3. Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

## 3rd Law: Make it easy

The Japanese concept of Lean Production focus on reducing all kinds of waste from the production process. It is achieved by redesigning workspaces, production process, and others. The workers did not have to waste time turning and twisting to reach their tools. The results made Japanese factories more efficient and products more reliable when compared to American ones. In 1974 service call for American TVs were 5 times more common than the Japanese TVs. By 1979 it required 3 times longer for American companies to assemble their products.

1. Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
2. Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3. Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
4. Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
5. Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

## 4th Law: Make it satisfying

Since 1800 chewing gun is commercially available, however it only became a worldwide habit after 1891. Initially there was no taste to it, but Wrigley add flavour of Speamint and Juicy Fruit, and that revolutionized the market. They also start to advertise that chewing gun “Refresh Your Taste.” The immediate reinforcement helped people to adhere to the new habit. Wrigley became the most successful chewing gun in the world company.

1. Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
2. Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.
3. Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”
4. Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

## Inversion of 1st law: Make it invisible

If you want to stop playing video games, after you are done unplug the console and store it away.

1. Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. Inversion of the

## Inversion of 2nd law: Make it unattractive

The book Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking. is mentioned as a good book to stop smoking. The book emphasizes how smoking is a terrible idea. By the end you realize that it is not attractive at all. Here are some of the arguments taken from the book:

- "You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you."
- "You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all."
- "You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them."
- "You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life."

1. Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. Inversion of the

## Inversion of 3rd law: Make it difficult

The author request his assistant to change the password for all social medias every Monday. By Friday she will provide him the passwords, so he only had the weekend to waste time on them.

1. Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.
2. Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you. Inversion of the.

## Inversion of 4th law: Make it unsatisfying

Roger Fisher founded the Harvard Negotiation Project. He had a very interesting solution for the problem of giving access to nuke codes to the presidents of the United States. The death cause by lunching a nuclear weapon will not "real" to the president because it happens thousands of kilometers away. It is very simple to just lunch it. His solution was to implant the codes in the chest of volunteer, and that person would cary a butcher knife. In the situation of the president want to have access the codes, they will have to kill the volunteer to obtain them. Now the death is very real. Would the president back off? By doing it, they save thousands of lives. Of course this was never implemented, unfortunately.

1. Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior.
2. Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.](<

# Summary

*Atomic Habits* by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) is about changing habits or developing new ones. It proposes a framework consisting of 4 laws that can be used to achieve significant changes in our lives. The book includes anecdotes from various fields such as sports and business. The goal is to find simple and easy things that lead to a huge impact once they accumulate. The book is described as a manual/framework for applying changes to our lives to harness transformative changes.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. — location: 155 

</div></div>


# Habits

A habit is something that is done over and over, usually automatically. Some habits are good, while others are not so good.

Clear started a blog out of his habit of writing, which eventually led him to a thousand subscribers. This reminds me of the book [[Show your Work\|Show your Work]], where we should share our work instead of marketing ourselves, and eventually, people will find us.

Dave Brailsford is a cycling coach who was hired and changed the history of the British cycling team. The British team had never won the Tour de France in 110 years, the most important event in the category. With the changes proposed by Brailsford from 2007 to 2017, the team won 178 world championships, 6 Olympic medals, and 5 Tour de France titles, considered the most successful run in cycling history. What he did was break down every single aspect of cycling and look to improve each by 1%. When all those changes were put in place, it resulted in a phenomenal change.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



“The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” — location: 223

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable — location: 249

There is a statistic, which I have no clue how to calculate, that if you improve by 1% every day, by the end of the year, you are 37 times better than when you started. This reminds me of [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]], how each work informs what needs to be worked on in the next piece.

# The Enemy

The problem with habits is that they are hard, and improvements take time to manifest. To intellectually prove this, consider that if a plane leaves the LAX airport and adjusts the course by **only** 3.5%, it will land in Washington, D.C. instead of New York.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. — location: 266 

</div></div>


The goal is to make small changes that will lead to different behavior. Everyone wants to achieve something, but in order to get there, it is required to make adjustments as we go; therefore, the journey is what matters, and the result is just a consequence.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. — location: 280 

</div></div>


A parallel with compound interest is drawn, where the outcome is the result of compound interest, which could be positive or negative. Everything can benefit from that. The more you help people, the more you can find people willing to help you. On the other side of the spectrum, if you constantly have negative thoughts about yourself, it is likely that you see life and things that happen to you through the same lenses.

There was one day that I attended a dance party. My first 4 dances were horrible, and the fact that I had just started dancing about 2 months prior destroyed my confidence. That night I did not dance with other people.

# Results

Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. — location: 318 

</div></div>


We all want the result, but we don't commit to the changes. People make a change and fail to keep doing it because no result or progress is evident. There is no workaround; we need to stick to the changes until the result finally becomes visible. This is called the **Plateau of Latent Potential**.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. — location: 327 

</div></div>


The funny thing is people never realize the effort you put towards something, but when the change happens, they see it as an overnight change. That is one of the reasons I believe people underappreciate the artist; they don't see the process behind it.

# System

What we want to achieve is our goal, but it won't happen without meaningful and intentional actions; that is the process, and it should be our focus. Think about the goal as the direction you have to take, your end goal, your destination. The process is the actions you take to get there. What way should you take to get where you want?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD — location: 351

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. — location: 358 

</div></div>


The reason people fail to achieve their goal is that the process is not working properly. It requires analysis and alterations as we go. The mentality should be about what we can do now, rather than what we want to achieve. Our commitment to the process will decide the end result.

That reminds me again of [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]], where it mentions that as soon as the artist strokes the canvas for the first time, it will decide how it will look in the end. That is because it is a chain reaction. The first stroke will lead to the next one, limited by the current one.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. — location: 388 

</div></div>


# Identity

In order to make changes, we need to focus on what needs to be changed and how to change them. For that, there are 3 layers:

- Outcome: this is what you get out of it.
- Process: this is what you do.
- Identity: this is what you believe.

Many times people struggle to make changes because they are solely based on the outcome they want to achieve. That can be a daunting task. What Clear proposes is that we should make changes based on identity. It is about who you are and who you want to be. In the book, he mentioned a person offering a cigarette to someone. They can answer: "I quit," or "I am not a smoker." This is a change in their identity; if I am not a smoker, there is no reason to accept a cigarette, however, if I quit, you may fall short.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes. — location: 458

Everything we do has a belief behind it, and most of the time, we are not really aware of it. The goal is to identify that and change it. That also includes bad habits; what is the second gain of our bad habits?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. — location: 466 

</div></div>


People will always be motivated to do things that bring them pride. So when people start to make changes, they fall short because it is not connected to their identity. We can always change our goals into an identity:

- I want to read more → I want to be a reader.
- I want to write more → I want to become a writer.
- I want to exercise more → I want to live healthier.

The beliefs we have are also hindering our abilities to move forward. How many people do you know say:

- I am terrible at names.
- I am terrible at directions.

Those are beliefs that can be changed, but the person sees themselves as that, so it will be almost impossible to change them because THEY ARE terrible at X.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. — location: 510 

</div></div>


Changes are hard because they confront our inner values and beliefs; however, if we want to become the best version of ourselves, we need to constantly adjust our identity.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. — location: 518

In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” — location: 521 

</div></div>


Every time someone forgets somebody's name, they prove to themselves that they are bad at remembering names. That will lead to the identity of being horrible about names. Every time I make art, I reinforce that I am an artist. So, identities are not something rigid and inflexible; they are just an accumulation of "proofs."

When I started coaching trampoline, at the end of one of my classes, my boss asked me what the names of the children that attend it are. I drew a blank and looked stupid for not knowing. Then she asked me to try to remember at least one name per class. Guess what, I started putting effort into remembering their names, and in just a few classes, I had memorized all the names. Despite the good intentions of my boss, I felt that I wasn't doing my best at work, so that prompted me to change ASAP.

When I visited Tokyo in 2019, I attended a Collage Exhibition called the Miracle of Silence by Toshiko Okanoue. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I pulled out my iPad and started collaging. A collagist does collage, so I did one. For the next several months, I did collages about any ideas I had. I was not caring about the results; I wanted to do it! I was obsessed with exploring all the possibilities. Eventually, people started to compliment my art, and that made me confident about what I do. For your amusement, here's my first work and the work I consider my best.

- **Who do you wish to become?**

# Habit formation


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. — location: 612 

</div></div>


When we have no reference about a certain thing, we may do good or bad. Those will be remembered later and will help you decide how to proceed in a similar situation. If it was bad, you will do something differently, but if it was good, you will tend to repeat.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. — location: 621 

</div></div>


According to behavioral scientist Jason Hreha: “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

The more familiarity you have with a situation, the more you will automatically respond to it based on your previous encounters. Without actively thinking about it, you are predicting what you should do that will lead to the best outcome possible. Once this decision is automatic, you free up your mental energy, which becomes available for something else. If you have good habits established, your mental energy will be available to focus on whatever you want. In that sense, a habit leads to freedom.

Habits are formed based on 4 simple steps:

- **Cue**: the trigger that makes you do something.
- **Craving**: what changes do you want to happen? If you are hungry, you want to feel satisfied;
- **Response**: this is what you do to change your craving. Once you are hungry, you eat.
- **Reward**: this is what satisfies your craving. Now you feel full.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. — location: 664 

</div></div>


Any stimuli we receive can potentially trigger a habit; they need to be interpreted. The craving is what you want to change in the current moment; I want to feel warmer, so you put a jacket on, that is your response, and as you feel better and warmer, you get your reward. Since you learned that putting on a jacket made you feel warmer, this will help you decide what to do in the future when confronted with a similar situation.

When the response requires more energy than you have available or are willing to expend, most likely you will not do anything.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. — location: 690 

</div></div>


# Awareness


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — location: 839 

</div></div>


Japan implemented a system called Pointing-and-Calling for the train operators, which basically requests someone to say something out loud as they execute. This technique reduces mistakes because it forces people to pay attention to what they are doing. It seems silly, but it reduced mistakes by 85% and accidents by 30%. New York City adopted a similar technique, and the incorrectly berthed subways fell by 57%. The demand to use multiple parts of their body—eyes, mouth, fingers, and ears—increase the chance to notice something wrong. Just like mentioned in the book, when I leave a place, I speak out loud what I need with me: cellphone, wallet, keys, and etc.

That technique reveals that we fail at doing something due to the lack of awareness. So if you want to change something, the first step is to realize what you are doing. As an exercise, the book proposes to make a **Habit Scorecard**:

- Make a list of your daily habits (p. 64):
	- Wake up
	- Turn off alarm
	- Check my phone
	- Go to the bathroom
	- Weigh myself
	- Take a shower
	- Brush my teeth
	- Floss my teeth
	- Put on deodorant
	- Hang up towel to dry
	- Get dressed
	- Make a cup of tea
- Beside each habit, add a + sign for a positive habit, add - for a negative habit, and = for a neutral habit (p. 65).
	- Wake up =
	- Turn off alarm =
	- Check my phone –
	- Go to the bathroom =
	- Weigh myself +
	- Take a shower +
	- Brush my teeth +
	- Floss my teeth +
	- Put on deodorant +
	- Hang up towel to dry =
	- Get dressed =
	- Make a cup of tea +

To decide which one is good (+), neutral (=), or bad (-), ask yourself: Which ones help you become who you want to be? How are they benefiting you in the long run?

If you are not sure, say out loud what are the consequences of doing a certain behaviour. It will make it more real and easier to identify the bad one.

# Making Changes

A research has identified that the more precisely you describe something, the more likely that you will do it. They nominate this process as **Implementation Intention**. Describe when and how you will do something.

**“During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”**


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. — location: 935 

</div></div>


Sometimes what is stopping you from starting to do something is a lack of awareness or clarity of how and when to do something. If you have a plan, your chances to do something will be higher.

==***I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]***==

Behavior is like a link in a chain. One thing leads to another. We can use this principle to our advantage. Identify some habits you already do and add something as the next step after it. This is called **Habit Stacking**.

***==After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]==***

This is very similar to hypnotic triggers: When I snap my fingers, you will laugh because it is very funny.

# Environment

The environment significantly influences your habits. Depending on where you are, different habits can be triggered. This can be demonstrated via the equation.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). — location: 1064

Our vision plays a crucial role in our behaviour. In fact, we have about 11 million sensory receptors, and 10 out of those 11 million are dedicated to vision. Visual cues strongly trigger habits. By making something more visible, we enhance the chances of doing it. For example, if you want to drink more water, place a bottle of water in every room. Conversely, if you want to reduce a habit, make the cue invisible. To decrease phone usage, keep it away in another room.

People often think that sticking to good habits and avoiding temptation requires a lot of willpower. However, research proves that individuals with good habits are simply better at avoiding temptation. So, make the good ones visible and hide the temptations.

My good friend Maul once commented on the dynamic change in the house of some relatives. The living room, initially without a television, fostered conversations among people. Once they added a television, people stopped talking and spent more time watching TV. Similarly, when I moved to my current place, I decided not to have a TV in the living room, as it is a space for human interaction.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another — location: 1154

A good practice is to create a single association with a specific habit. Spending a lot of time watching television in the bedroom creates a strong association with the TV, making it more difficult to fall asleep. In fact, research suggests that people should only go to bed when they are tired, and if they cannot sleep, they must leave the bedroom. Over time, this establishes an association between the bed and sleep.

# Temptations & Motivation

People can change their habits, but that doesn't mean they will forget about them. The key to success is discipline, and to make it easier, we should design our environment accordingly. That's why resisting temptation is challenging; once you know what reward you can get, you are likely to fall short.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. — location: 1218 

</div></div>


If a cue triggers a habit, we can make it more visible and supercharged to make something happen. The greater the stimuli, the greater the effort applied.

Currently, the majority of available food is designed for contrast, such as popcorn that is salty and sweet simultaneously. This contrast keeps the eating experience novel, making it addictive. This is a supercharged stimulus.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. — location: 1284 

</div></div>


Addictive things exaggerate something to increase desire (cue): pornography, beauty standards, constant likes that deliver more praise than we can get in a lifetime. This causes a dopamine spike in our brains.

A study conducted by neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner in 1954 revealed that by suppressing dopamine, rats lost the desire to be alive. They wouldn't eat or procreate; they didn't crave anything. In a few days, they all died. Dopamine is not only associated with pleasure but plays a fundamental role in motivation, learning, memory, and voluntary movement. When our brains predict that something will lead to a reward, there is a spike in dopamine.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. — location: 1339 

</div></div>


Our brain's reward system is activated when we receive one or predict that we will receive a reward. So, anticipation can be as rewarding as the thing itself. That's why when our emotions are triggered, they win even when the logical explanation is way more reasonable.

Knowing that we are driven by reward, we can attach something we need to do to something we must do. I hate doing dishes, so I have a bad habit of accumulating a pile. To motivate me to clean it, I start listening to audiobooks while doing the dishes. Funny enough, I become more excited as the pile grows. Side note: after reading this book, I am making changes to not accumulate dishes.

**Variable reward** is the concept of providing rewards in a non-predictable order. Slot machines are the perfect example. Players know they could win the next time, but they might not. The unknown keeps them addicted to it. The variance in the reward creates the greatest spike in dopamine, making habit formation faster.

***==The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]==***

Doesn't it sound like gamification?

When it comes to motivation, it is essential to work on tasks that prove to be a challenge. If they are too easy, you'll likely lose interest. If they are too difficult, you'll give up. When a task is challenging but just enough, that keeps you going. This is called the **Goldilocks Rule**.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. — location: 2781

# Influences

Here's a captivating story from 1965 about Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian man who applied his theory to nurture genius. He decided to teach chess to three sisters, immersing them completely in the world of chess. The children spent hours playing together, receiving constant compliments for their achievements. The environment was intentionally crafted to amplify anything related to chess. The culture fostered motivation and reward rather than force or coercion. As a result, Sofia, the middle child, became the world champion at the age of 14 and a grandmaster a few years later. Judith, the youngest, achieved grandmaster status at the age of 15, becoming the youngest grandmaster of all time. This incredible feat was only possible due to intentional and intrinsic habit design.

Beyond genetics, our identities are shaped by our environment and the people around us. Our habits are inherited from those in our proximity. The closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate them. With this in mind, a powerful strategy is to surround yourself with individuals who embody the traits you aspire to possess. These individuals become living representations of the identity you wish to cultivate. This concept resonates with the idea of a "Scenius" from [[Show your Work\|Show your Work]]:

We are inherently designed to be part of a group. Studies conducted in the 1950s by psychologist Solomon Asch demonstrated that people conform to lies due to peer pressure and self-doubt. In the study, participants were presented with a card displaying lines of different lengths and tasked with identifying the matching lines on another card. The majority intentionally chose the wrong line, and the greater the number of people making the incorrect choice, the higher the chance that a subject, unaware of the plot, would comply with the wrong answer. Nearly 75% of people went along with the incorrect choice.

When seeking something, we often check reviews done by others. We have a natural tendency to want to belong, even if it means being wrong. This reminds me of how seemingly normal and sane people get involved with cults, as explored in the documentary [The Vow about NXIVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vow_(TV_series)).

Regarding the people who influence us, they can be categorized into three groups:

- **The Closest:** Family and friends.
- **The Mass:** The collective "hive" of individuals like us.
- **The Powerful:** Celebrities, the wealthy, and influencers.

This behavior is deeply rooted historically, as more power often leads to increased opportunities. We naturally strive to be among the top and take actions to avoid lowering our status.

# Craving

Behind our cravings lie fundamental, basic truths. Here are some of them:

- Conserve energy.
- Obtain food and water.
- Find love.
- Reproduction.
- Connection and belonging.
- Social acceptance.
- Reduce uncertainty.
- Achieve status and prestige.
- I would add shelter to this list.
- Minimum effort possible.

A smoker wasn't born with a desire to smoke, but the act of doing it reduces anxiety; it changes the current state. By recalling past events, the smoker predicts the best way to relieve anxiety. Habits, therefore, are solutions for current situations learned over time. The desire to change your current state is what motivates your actions.

# Reframing

We can perceive things as half-empty or half-full. The moment we view something as a problem or a chore, it becomes just that.

%3E [!quote] "If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.” - Abraham Maslow

The book shares an anecdote about someone asking a person in a wheelchair if it was difficult to be confined. The unexpected response was that the person felt free, not confined, because without the wheelchair, they would be bed-bound.

How can you change your vocabulary to see things from a new perspective?

How can you reframe your habits to highlight their benefits?

# Action

Motivation is the key to adhering to a habit. To maximize a new habit, associate it with something you enjoy. Regardless of what you need to do, taking action is essential for change.

A noteworthy anecdote involves a photography class where the teacher divided students into two groups. Group 1 would be graded based on the quantity of pictures taken, while Group 2 would be assessed on the quality of a picture, even if it was just one. Surprisingly, Group 1 had numerous pictures, while Group 2 had none as they spent time debating what would constitute a perfect picture. A similar story is shared in [[Art & Fear\|Art & Fear]], but in a pottery class.

The book introduces the concept of Motion and Action. Planning and studying are motions, but they don't generate results. If you're researching and reading references to write an article, that's motion. The article only comes into existence when you take action to write it. While motion provides direction, action makes the real difference. This resonates with the idea of focusing on the process rather than the goal.

Forming a habit requires repeated action. It's not about how long you do something; it's about how often you do it.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” — location: 1735

Taking action requires effort, and as humans, we naturally seek comfort and apply the least amount of effort possible—the **Law of Least Effort**. No one desires the habit itself; we want the benefits it delivers. Habits are methods to solve issues, and our aim is to have those issues resolved. Therefore, making things as easy as possible ensures you will follow through, even when motivation is lacking.

Neglecting to take action is detrimental in the long run. The secret is to consistently act even when motivation is low. Your identity should align, and the effort required should be easy and attractive to encourage action.

Rather than fighting difficulties, find ways around them. To make something easier, reduce the friction to take action. Designing your environment can significantly propel you into action. For example, if you want to drink more water, place water bottles in every room to minimize the effort of walking to the kitchen. Additionally, consider where you do things; find places close to your current routine. If the gym is conveniently located between your work and home, you're more likely to go.

On the other hand, increasing friction can make something harder to do. To stop watching TV, unplug it and have someone hide the remote. For an added challenge, remove the batteries and store them far away. Now, watching TV requires considerable effort.

Earlier, I mentioned making changes to my habit of cleaning dishes. Instead of accumulating piles, I now apply two strategies: clean each plate after eating, and practice **Resetting the Room**, a concept from Oswald Nuckols. Resetting the room involves returning the environment to its original configuration after each activity. This ensures that the space is always ready for use.

Habits function like links in a chain. Action X leads to action Y. To minimize effort, make your habits easy. Meditating for an hour may seem daunting, but starting with just one minute is much more manageable. The key is not to let the activity become an issue.

As a former trampoline athlete, one habit the coach instilled when learning a new skill was to stop when it was good enough for the day. The goal was not perfection, but consistent improvement without becoming burdensome.

This concept of reducing something to a bare minimum to make it easier is known as the **Two-Minute Rule**. The goal is to reinforce the identity we aspire to be.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. — location: 2044 

</div></div>


Another strategy to increase difficulty is a **Commitment Device**. For example, if you want to gamble less, voluntarily add your name to the banned list. If you wish to reduce social media use, set a daily time limit. The harder it is to do something, the less likely you are to engage in it.

# Small Victories

As mentioned at the beginning, the challenge with taking action in the realm of habits is that results often take time to materialize. This is referred to as a **delayed-return environment.** Many of our actions precede visible outcomes, and this has been the case for most of human existence. Only in the last 500 years, a mere blip in evolutionary terms, have we shifted to living our lives in a delayed-return environment. This shift presents a unique challenge. Behaviours such as smoking offer instant gratification while delaying the consequences. It becomes imperative to question whether the instant pleasure and rewards align with your long-term goals and identity.

Despite the inevitable need to ignore instant rewards in favor of delayed ones, it is beneficial to embed bits of immediate pleasure into the activities you need to do. For example, listening to an audiobook while doing the dishes can make the task more enjoyable. Conversely, introducing a bit of discomfort can aid in breaking unwanted habits.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. — location: 2284 

</div></div>


To solidify a habit, one needs to experience a sense of progress or success. This feeling signifies that your efforts are paying off. An effective strategy involves incorporating visual indicators of progression. For instance, if your goal is to save money, open a savings account and designate it for something you desire, like a Leather Jacket; if you can name it as Leather Jacket. Each contribution visually reinforces progress and brings you closer to your goal—an immediate reinforcement.

Another engaging strategy is the paper clip method. Get two bowls. Fill one bowl with paper clips or small objects. Every positive step you take toward your habit earns you a move from one bowl to another. Witnessing more objects in the second bowl than the first provides a visually satisfying representation of your progress. If, for example, you need to make numerous work-related phone calls, track your progress one paper clip at a time.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. — location: 2378 

</div></div>


# Tracking

Research suggests that individuals who track their activities tend to be more successful in working toward their goals. Whether it's tracking weight, calories, or other metrics, being honest with yourself through tracking is crucial. We often hold distorted views about our own behaviour, and tracking provides several benefits:

- **Obviousness:** You have tangible evidence of changes.
- **Attractiveness:** You witness evidence of progress.
- **Satisfaction:** Seeing changes and progress feels good, fostering motivation to continue.

Tracking habits involves paying attention to the process, a fundamental aspect of habit formation. However, it's essential to note that tracking can create additional work, becoming a source of friction for some. Automating or simplifying tracking as much as possible increases the likelihood of consistent implementation.

It's crucial to emphasize that what we measure or track is what we aim to optimize. Choosing the right metrics is paramount, as the wrong measurement may reinforce undesired behavior. Measurement serves as a guide, providing insights to see the bigger picture rather than being the end goal itself.

# Breaking the Habit

Everyone falls short and fails to do what they're supposed to at times. Missing a diet, leaving the dishes for tomorrow, or similar lapses are okay in moderation. However, when such deviations become the norm, addressing the issue becomes imperative. If possible, the principle of never missing something twice can be highly effective. For instance, if you skip the gym today, commit to not missing it tomorrow. Consider the perspective of a healthy and athletic person—what would they do?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. — location: 2421

You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” — location: 2427

The more immediate the punishment for an action, the higher the likelihood of avoiding it. A **habit contract** is a practical application of this idea. An anecdote illustrates this concept: Bryan Harris aimed to lose weight and created a habit contract with his wife and coach. If he failed to document his food consumption or weigh himself, he committed to dressing up every workday and Sunday for the quarter, in addition to giving $200 to his coach. They all signed the contract, and as conditions were later increased, he successfully achieved his weight loss goal.

# Pick Your Battles

Our genetic code provides a predisposition that can either support or hinder us depending on the circumstances. Individuals excelling in various sports often possess both competence and a genetic predisposition for their activities. Take Michael Phelps, a highly successful swimmer with a physique well-suited for swimming due to relatively short legs and a long torso, making him less suited for running.

While genes influence areas where you might excel, they do not determine your destiny. The Big Five personality analysis—measuring openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism—is scientifically relevant and can be tracked from birth. This analysis helps in understanding one's predispositions.

The key is to pick your battles wisely. Choosing activities aligned with your predispositions makes success more likely. To identify these predispositions, ask yourself:

**What feels like fun for me, but work for others?**

**What makes me lose track of time?**

**Where do I get greater returns than the average person?**

**What comes naturally to me?**

These questions can assist you in recognizing activities that are probably more suited to your natural abilities. However, for those that pose a challenge, proficiency can be achieved by embracing a unique approach.

# Good Habits

Developing positive habits can significantly enhance your life over the long term. In the short term, the efficiency gained from spending less time and energy on trivial tasks allows you to allocate more resources to activities that truly matter.

However, it's crucial to avoid stagnation when cultivating good habits. Research indicates that once mastery is achieved, there is a slight decrease in performance. Therefore, it's important to keep challenging tasks alive to maintain continuous improvement.

Mastering a skill involves breaking it down and consistently improving each component until it becomes internalized. Regular analysis and reviews of your progress are essential, helping you remain aware and providing insights for further refinement.

The use of a **Decision Journal** is recommended to record important decisions, providing context for chosen courses of action and allowing for later reflection on their correctness.

Beliefs play a pivotal role in driving change, but it's important to note that allowing a singular belief to exclusively define your identity can act as a hindrance to adaptability. I once knew someone who wrestled with the idea of retirement for eight years, primarily because their profession had become intricately woven into their sense of self. It's crucial to be mindful of how you frame your beliefs. Choosing to identify solely as an athlete, for instance, can be more restrictive compared to embracing a broader identity—one that encompasses mental fortitude and a passion for overcoming physical challenges.

While acknowledging the benefits of habits, it's essential not to confine yourself to the constraints of outdated thought patterns and behaviours. Embrace the dynamism of personal growth and be open to evolving your mindset and actions beyond past routines.

The key to improvement lies in making small, sustainable enhancements, striving to be 1% better a thousand times.

Happiness manifests in the absence of desire. In the absence of longing, the impetus for change diminishes. The pursuit of achievement and pleasure centers around fulfillment and satisfaction, representing the very cravings we seek to transform. Often, our inclination is towards the pursuit of pleasure, a concept Lacan aptly refers to as the object of desire.

> "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." - Friedrich Nietzsche

Curiosity surpasses intelligence, as being curious prompts action, and action leads to change. Emotions play a pivotal role in behaviour, with rationality following emotional responses. When suffering prompts a desire for change, and ignoring a desire leads to unsatisfied cravings, altering the craving itself is more effective than mere avoidance.

Attaining peace is contingent upon resisting the transformation of observations into problems. If there is no desire to act upon these observations, tranquility prevails.

When the reason is bigger than the obstacles, you will find a way.

> [!quote] "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." - Friedrich Nietzsche

In the pursuit of personal development, fostering curiosity holds greater merit than sheer intelligence. Curiosity compels action, serving as a catalyst for change.

Emotions, rather than logic, steer behavior. Damage to the emotional centers of the brain impedes action and, consequently, hinders the capacity for change. The interplay between System 1 (emotional responses and rapid judgments) and System 2 (rational analysis) underscores the dominance of feelings over logic. Convincing people through data necessitates an appeal to emotion.

Suffering serves as a catalyst for change, prompting individuals to address the sources of pain.

Neglecting a desire leads to unsatisfied cravings, contributing to our failure to resist them. The key lies not in ignoring but in transforming the cravings themselves.

The level of expectation directly influences one's satisfaction, with higher expectations correlating to increased pain.

Achieving satisfaction happens when liking something is bigger than how much you want it.

The impetus for change arises from the feeling that prompts action. Subsequently, the feeling of satisfaction perpetuates the repetition of positive behaviours.

# Laws of Behaviour Change

Lets make break for a really funny passage:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Another woman I came across in my research was a former preschool teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now working with adults, her old habits would kick in and she kept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the bathroom. — location: 831

Can you imagine asking your boss?

The Laws of behaviour changes are:

- **1st Law: Make it obvious** (cue)
- **2nd Law: Make it attractive** (craving)
- **3rd Law: Make it easy** (response)
- **4th Law: Make it satisfying** (reward)

Those same Laws can be inverted as:

- **Inversion of 1st law: Make it invisible** (cue)
- **Inversion of 2nd law: Make it unattractive** (craving)
- **Inversion of 3rd law: Make it difficult** (response)
- **Inversion of 4th law: Make it unsatisfying** (reward)

## 1st Law: Make it obvious

Anne Thorndike devised an ingenious solution to enhance the habits of visitors and staff at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, without directly requesting any changes or engaging in discussions with them.

They initiated a redesign of the cafeteria and conducted a six-month study. Water bottles were introduced to the existing refrigerators, and additionally, bottles of water were strategically placed next to all food stations in the room. Within three months, soda sales experienced a decline of 11.4%, while water sales witnessed a significant increase of 25.8%.

1. Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
2. Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
3. Use habit stacking: “After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
4. Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

## 2nd Law: Make it attractive

Ronan Byrne ingeniously applied his engineering expertise by modifying his stationary bike to interact with his laptop and television. His love for Netflix was intertwined with physical activity; he could only watch the streaming service if he maintained a specific cycling speed or faster. If he slowed down or reduced the speed, the show would automatically pause.

1. Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
3. Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

## 3rd Law: Make it easy

The Japanese concept of **Lean Production** centers around minimizing various forms of waste in the production process. This is accomplished through the redesign of workspaces, production processes, and other elements. Workers no longer wasted time turning and twisting to reach their tools, leading to increased efficiency in Japanese factories and enhanced reliability of products compared to their American counterparts. A notable example is the contrast in service calls for American TVs, which were five times more common than Japanese TVs in 1974. Additionally, by 1979, American companies took three times longer to assemble their products compared to Japanese counterparts.

1. Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
2. Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3. Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
4. Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
5. Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

## 4th Law: Make it satisfying

Since 1800, chewing gum has been commercially available; however, it only became a worldwide habit after 1891. Initially lacking any distinct taste, Wrigley revolutionized the market by adding flavors such as Spearmint and Juicy Fruit. They also began advertising chewing gum as a way to "Refresh Your Taste." The immediate reinforcement provided by the added flavor helped individuals adhere to this new habit, making Wrigley the most successful chewing gum company globally.

1. Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
2. Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.
3. Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”
4. Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

## Inversion of 1st law: Make it invisible

If you wish to quit playing video games, once you've finished, unplug the console and store it away.

1. Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. Inversion of the

## Inversion of 2nd law: Make it unattractive

The book "Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking" is highly recommended for individuals seeking assistance in quitting smoking. It underscores the detrimental nature of smoking, portraying it as an unfavorable choice. By the conclusion of the book, readers arrive at the realization that smoking is not attractive at all. Here are some arguments extracted from the book:

- "You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you."
- "You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all."
- "You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them."
- "You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life."

1. Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. Inversion of the

## Inversion of 3rd law: Make it difficult

The author requests his assistant to change the passwords for all social media accounts every Monday. By Friday, she will provide him with the passwords, allowing him only the weekend to indulge in these platforms.

1. Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.
2. Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you. Inversion of the.

## Inversion of 4th law: Make it unsatisfying

Roger Fisher, founder of the Harvard Negotiation Project, proposed an intriguing solution to the dilemma of granting access to nuclear codes to U.S. presidents. The potential consequences of launching a nuclear weapon may not feel "real" to the president, given the distance of thousands of kilometers. The process seems simple and detached. Fisher's solution involved implanting the codes in the chest of a volunteer, who would carry a butcher knife. If the president sought access to the codes, they would have to kill the volunteer to obtain them, making the potential death more palpable. This extreme measure aimed to deter hasty decisions and potentially save thousands of lives. Of course this proposal was never implemented.

1. Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior.
2. Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.
