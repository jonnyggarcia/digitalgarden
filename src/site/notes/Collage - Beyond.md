**Context:** This collage is construction of a face using 7 different pictures. The precision cuts are to illustrate how fake the construction is. The images have been altered to look like metallic gold. The constructed face is placed on a frame which is on display. We choose and like what interest to us; the challenge is to really see the other person beyond or own bias and limited perspectives. How can we valorize others rather than what we imagine and desire about them? This is collage is about how to not see my past and project what I want on my current relationship.
