Constantly acquiring new skills, Jeanna recently learned how to create prints. Regardless of the technique she employs, she consistently strives to express herself in the language of collage, maintaining her own aesthetic.

Jeanna employs watercolour paint as a base with collage layered on top.

Her work speaks the language of collage, utilizing prints.

Additionally, she incorporates 3D elements.

When working on a specific topic, lots of research about the topic including the content and imagery.

### Series

- Curate a playlist and reading list.
- Visit exhibition to broaden influences.

### Sources

Initially, the requirement was that sources had to be entirely original, posing a challenge when considering the use of materials from archives and libraries.

However, the realization that libraries and archives offer a wealth of digital materials changed her mind. This not only addresses the initial challenge but also provides the opportunity to print and scale up creations, broadening the scope of artistic possibilities.

## Process

- Utilizes an Exacto knife.
- Progress is deliberately slow due to real-life commitments (work, family), emphasizing a thoughtful and intentional approach.
- Dedicates significant time to research, sourcing, and pre-production.
- Prefers heavy watercolour paper mounted on substrate
- 2x4 foot pieces.
- Primarily engages in analog collage.
- Incorporates various painting mediums such as watercolor, acrylic, Indian ink, and markers.
- Drawing elements as well.
- Invests considerable time in deciding on the composition, often spanning weeks.
- Protects images with transparent 8.5x11 envelopes, which also serve as tools for experimenting with composition.
- Documents the artistic process consistently.
- After finalizing the composition, photographs the work and explores further possibilities in Photoshop.
- Experiences anxiety regarding the background, as the paper is mounted, making painting mistakes costly.
- Experiences anxiety during the gluing process due to the uniqueness of the materials used.

## Making

In late 2021, Jeanna acquired a dedicated studio space featuring versatile Home Depot working tables that can be easily relocated based on her needs. This studio space not only accommodates her creative pursuits but also provides an opportunity for her child to witness her in the role of an artist.

Jeanna operates a mural painting company, offering valuable resources that streamline her work. This connection not only facilitates her creative process but also instills a productive mindset. Each phase of the artistic process brings unique expectations and procedures. On painting days, the entire dynamic of the day undergoes a transformation.

# Final Presentation

The aim of this workshop is to empower participants to address their artistic practice and facilitate desired changes.

The concluding session will take the form of a presentation. Organize the presentation using the framework outlined below.

![Art Framework.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Art%20Framework.png)

The process of articulating these points will enable you to delve into your aspirations and connect with others to gain further insights.

Cultivate self-understanding and refine the language describing your work. This clarity will aid in devising effective strategies to attain your goals.

Reflect on your current progress with each step.

Select six images that represent each stage of the artistic practice.

- 20 seconds per image
- What is the key message or information that you consider the most important for people to know?

# Artist Statement

Criticism of a generic art statement ([link to google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1scB8SwybBpyL2fRFbWMZ77IrAdKw45Jdo1y97A4JZ_8/edit))

Why should you pay attention to what is being said?

Examine each sentence individually and assess its meaningfulness without the need for elaborate language. The art statement should not merely describe the work; it should evoke an understanding of the work you do.

The objective is to scrutinize the language—each sentence must convey meaningful information. Articulate precisely what you do, elucidating the materials and processes involved. Artist statements may be project-specific or encompass the broader practice, with variations based on the intended audience.

Maintaining a balance between the professional and personal aspects is crucial.

A useful strategy involves recording yourself describing each stage of the art practice and subsequently editing the content. The written expression might exude more confidence than we feel internally.

Choosing between the first and third person narration lacks clear guidance. The decision should be guided by what feels right and the feedback received.

# Copyright

Collage artists often grapple with copyright concerns as they incorporate elements of others' work into their creations. The consequences of copyright infringement are nuanced. While advisors can offer guidance on usage, only a jury or judge can definitively decide what constitutes a legal use.

The distinction between what can or cannot be used is not always clear-cut. Legal action is typically taken if it is deemed financially worthwhile; the cost and effort involved in suing someone can be substantial.

## Fair Use

Artists inherently incorporate the work of others in some way, even when intellectual property is owned by someone else. There exists a certain degree of permissible use.

As humans and as a society, we have a fundamental need for shared resources. Artists, in particular, occupy a unique space in society, utilizing and building upon what is available.

[CAA resource](https://www.collegeart.org/programs/caa-fair-use/best-practices)

- Based on U.S. law, it might differ around the world. However, the moral aspect remains the same.
- Limitations
	- Don't change the medium without creating something new.
		- When [David Elliot](https://www.instagram.com/davidelliottpaintings/?hl=en) paints a diorama, there is no new meaning added. Since it's his own creation there are no issues.
		- Is this merely embellishment?
- Have a clear intention behind your choices:
	- Why did you choose this particular medium?
	- Why are you pursuing this specific approach?
- Avoid claiming originality of the source material and always cite your sources:
	- This helps curators build context and ensures ethical handling of intellectual property.

Materials produced by the U.S. government are not copyrighted by the government.

### Materials

What are the implications of using materials? The materials themselves have an impact and convey a message.

```

- Using a particular source material can implicate your art, regardless of your intention.
- For instance, consider the Pears soap brand, which in the past had racist posters. An artist used this material to provoke thought about its historical context ([Kolaj article](https://kolajmagazine.com/content/content/articles/just-for-the-record/)).
- Similarly, incorporating a picture of a young Hitler raises questions about the implications it brings to the work.
