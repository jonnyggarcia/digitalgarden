**Corridinho** (little run) is a variation of [[Kiz - Basic 3\|Basic 3]], where both the lead and follower walk together in a circle. This movement can be executed in both directions (left and right) and in both ways (forward and backward). It can be performed in closed or open positions. The open position will be discussed on [[Kiz - Passeio\|Passeio]].

Corridinho Forwards refers to when the lead walks forward. Conversely, Corridinho Backwards refers to when the lead walks backward. Although this move is usually performed to the left, it can also be done to the right.

The indication of a corridinho primarily comes from the chest, but the lead can enhance the information by gently lifting the right arm.

This move involves a dissociation between the upper and lower parts of the body. The feet trace the edge of the circle while the chest constantly points to the center of the circle.

**Walking Forward**

- Whoever is walking forward should use the internal leg (right) to seek connection with the partnerâ€™s inside thigh.

**Progression 1: Chest Dissociation**

- Place an object on the ground to mark the center of the circle.
- Position yourself one big step away from the object, with the object to your left.
- Raise both hands sideways to shoulder level.
- Pivot your chest towards the object. The legs should remain stationary.
- Point the right arm towards the object.
- Trace the circle behind you with the left arm.
- Walk around the object, keeping your torso pointing towards it.

Practice the same exercise with the object to the right.

Practice walking forward and backward.

**Progression 2: Connection**

- With a partner, the lead guides the follower to walk around the object.

Practice the same exercise with the object to the right.

Practice walking forward and backward.

**Progression 3: Figure 8**

- Place two objects to indicate the centers of two separate circles.
- Perform the corridinho, forming a figure 8 around each object.

This will allow you to practice both left and right directions, as well as changes in the middle.

Practice walking forward and backward.

**Progression 4: No torso connection**

- Perform progression 3, but without hands

Practice walking forward and backward.

*Key elements of the move*
- The walk can cover any number of steps: 1/4 circle, 1/2 circle, 3/4 circle, or a full circle.
- The lead and the follower walk together, tracing the circle. If the follower walks around the lead, who remains in place, it is not considered a Corridinho.
