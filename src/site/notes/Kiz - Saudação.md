**Saudação** (salute) is a mirrored move where the lead and the follower move backwards, perform a marca (closing the legs), and then move forward using the same leg.

The lead indicates the movement to the follower with a gentle push from the left hand while disconnecting the right arm. After the marca, the lead should gently pull the follower in and reconnect. This movement can be performed several times in a row.

**Variation**

When moving toward the partner, you can turn 180 degrees to face away from your partner. Then, reverse the direction as you open. The lead can signal the follower by moving their left hand to the left before the follower step forward.

*Keys elements of the move*
- The lead should give a clear intention to the follower, allowing them to step back. Then, the lead should gently pull the follower in.
