**Context:** This collage was a tentative to use abstraction. The man looks back to his past thinking about the woman who looks forward symbolizing that she moved on. The man is illuminated by the thoughts of her (yellow colour). This express all the regrets I have, and a tentative to apologize. This is one of my favorite pieces. This collage is also part of the series Abstract.

Apologies is an exploration of abstraction. The male figure looks back toward his past, contemplating the woman who gazes forward, symbolizing her decision to move on. He is illuminated by the memory of her, conveyed through the use of yellow, which embodies reflection, regret, and the longing for reconciliation. Part of the Abstract series, this work stands as one of the artist’s most personal and cherished pieces.
