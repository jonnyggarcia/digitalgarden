**Passeio** (go for a walk) is a disconnection step where both the lead and follower open 90 degrees, then walk and close back to closed position.

1. The lead indicates an opening to the follower with their left hand by gently pushing them away.
   - The lead will pivot their chest 90 degrees to the left while taking a step with their left leg and transferring their weight.
   - The follower will pivot their chest 90 degrees to the right while taking a step with their right leg and transferring their weight.
   - At this moment, the couple is in a mirrored position, facing the same direction. They must maintain connection with their thighs: the lead's right thigh with the follower's left thigh.
2. The lead's entire right hand should rest against the follower's back. With gentle pressure, the lead can push the follower forward while stepping with the right leg.
3. They can continue to walk as long as the lead maintains the intention to move forward.

**Exiting**

To finish the move and return to the closed position, the lead needs to indicate with their right hand.

**Lead**
1. When taking a right step:
   - The lead should use the tip of their right fingers to press against the follower's back.
2. The lead takes a small step with their left leg.
3. The lead steps to the right as in Basic 2 and marca. The lead should use their hands to indicate the direction.

**Follower**
1. When taking a left step, the follower will feel pressure from the lead's fingers against their back.
2. The follower will pivot their chest 180 degrees while stepping with their right leg.
3. Perform a Basic 2 to the left.

	- Instead of walking in a straight line, the lead will direct the walk to form a circle.
		- It can be done with or without **contratempo**:
		- **Without contratempo**: The lead and follower step at the same time with opposite legs.
		- **With contratempo**: The lead and follower step at the same time with the same leg.

*Key elements of the move*
- The thigh connection is crucial for the follower to know when to step.
- The lead's right hand should give a clear indication when walking forward.
- When walking backward, the lead's left hand should clearly indicate the movement. Also, the follower's left hand will feel the lead's chest moving backward.
- The lead must be clear about whether to use their entire palm or just their fingers. The entire palm indicates a walk, whereas the fingers signal to the follower to pivot their chest toward the lead.
