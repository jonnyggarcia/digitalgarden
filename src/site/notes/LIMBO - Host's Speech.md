Welcome to the place between life and death — the place beyond life and before eternity.

All of you may or may not move on. Some of you might go back. A few of you will be lost forever.

Your final destination will be decided here today. However, aggression, violence, rudeness, or disrespect will not change where you are heading next. But cooperation, dialogue, and empathy might change your final destination.

I welcome you to think about all the things that were left unfinished — to remember those who will miss you deeply but cannot come with you. I also ask you to consider those who might feel relieved, or even glad, that you are gone. Remember, sometimes only through the eyes of another can we truly see ourselves.

I welcome you to reflect — to find inner peace, acceptance, and forgiveness. Be bold, have the courage to move on.

I welcome you to Limbo.
