**Tic Tac** (the sound produced by an analog clock) is a connected step where the lead keeps the weight on one leg while moving the other leg in a repetitive motion. This move is used to emphasize the music.

**Lead**
1. Basic 2, close to the right.
2. Open the left leg to the side (beat 1). Hold the follower so they do not transfer their weight or move.
3. Close the left leg (marca on beat 2).
4. Repeat.

Note: Steps 2 and 3 can be done in any direction.

*Key elements of the move*
- Keep the weight on the same leg.
- Leads must clearly indicate that there is no weight shifting.
