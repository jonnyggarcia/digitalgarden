**Passarela** (catwalk, runway) is a left turn for the follower, starting with a left step to the left. It can be performed at any moment when the follower’s weight is on their right leg. The most common way to perform this turn is from Regra de 3.

**Leads**
1. Start by signalling a [[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]].
2. On the 3rd step, raise your left hand and maintain the momentum so the follower can perform a left turn.
3. Take a right step.
4. Take a left step.
5. Perform a **Basic 2** to the right.

**Followers**
1. The lead will signal a **[[Kiz - Regra de 3\|Regra de 3]]**.
2. On the 3rd step, the lead will provide a spinning momentum with their right hand.
3. Take a left step, turning 180 degrees to the left.
4. Take a right step, turning 180 degrees to the left. You should now be facing the lead.
5. Perform a **Basic 2** to the left.

**Variation: No Stride**
Instead of starting the move with a **Regra de 3**, the lead can initiate the spin right away.

1. Perform a **Basic 2** to the left.
2. Perform the turn from step 2 of the previous instructions.

**Variation: Passarela Dupla**
While the follower is performing the turn, the lead can release the left hand and perform a right turn.

**Variation**
- Conduzida (GC13-Z)

**Difference between Passarela and [[Kiz - Espiral\|Espiral]]**
- in Passarela the Lead generates momentum for the turn by turning their torso to the right.
- In Espiral, the Lead generates momentum by use the close action of passeio with their fingertips

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead needs to provide sufficient spinning momentum.
- When performing with the hands connected, the lead should not rush the follower’s turn.
- Followers must walk through their turn.
- Leads need to be attentive to reconnect after the follower completes their turn.
