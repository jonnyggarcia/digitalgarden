About a month ago, I reached out to David and told him I was interested in teaching group classes. I specifically asked if he was okay with it, because I didn’t want to be disrespectful in any way.

He said he was fine with it and even encouraged me to go ahead.

After that, I approached Melanie to inquire about renting the space, but she refused.

So, both of them knew this situation was likely to happen.

So, yesterday morning David posted about his classes at the studio in a WhatsApp group.

Around 10 PM, I posted about the group classes I’ll be teaching.

This morning, he reached out to me saying that Melanie, the owner of Studio G, was upset because she felt it was a conflict of interest.

I contacted Melanie, and she told me that it was unethical for me to post there, as the group is meant exclusively for Studio G students.

I explained that I’ve been promoting her studio widely and, since I DJ and teach there for free, I thought it would be okay to post.

According to her, the “compensation” for my efforts is the exposure I receive.

Okay—no harm done.

Meanwhile, David deleted my post about the classes.

Some people reached out to him asking why it was removed.

In response, he made a public post clarifying that it was a misunderstanding and that the group is only for promoting Studio G events.

Fine.

Then I asked Melanie if she still wants me to teach this coming Saturday.

As you can see, she later informed me that I’m no longer part of Studio G.

So, I made a polite and respectful post letting people know that I’m no longer affiliated with them.

![Pasted image 20250521103349.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103349.png)

Then David asked me to delete the post.

I told him I wouldn’t.

He kept insisting.

![Pasted image 20250521103627.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103627.png)

So, he took her side and tried to bury the whole situation.

That same day, my freedom of speech was denied twice—even though what I posted was never hateful, disrespectful, or aggressive.

So, I left the group.

That’s the story.

Feel free to talk to the others involved—everyone has their own version.

As for me, I’ve decided I will no longer support Melanie.

![Pasted image 20250521192513.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192513.png)

As I mentioned before, I respectfully disagree with his request to delete my post.

![Pasted image 20250521192530.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192530.png)

2: When I reached out to you about the group classes—especially now that I’m enrolled in the same teaching program that you trained under—there was no mention of me not being ready to teach. I wish you had shared that concern with me earlier.

3: First of all, I only teach because I genuinely want the community to grow. I’ve invested a lot of time and energy into Kizomba, and to be honest, it can be tiring. It would be much easier to simply show up at a social and enjoy dancing like everyone else.

But instead, I dedicate hours preparing personalized mixsets to play at the socials. I spend time researching music to ensure the community has access to quality tunes.

When you say I wouldn’t have access to those students without Studio G, I’d just like to point out that many of those people might not even be here if it weren’t for the work I’ve put in. When I wasn’t running the upstairs social, there was no social at all. The only reason the socials continued for almost a year was because I was there—playing music and making sure people had a space to dance.

As for teaching, I’ve only ever given private lessons to three people, all of whom were already part of your classes. A few others picked up things from me informally, and I never charged for that. I’ve never advertised or promoted my private lessons—only responded when people specifically asked.

The vast majority of people just danced with me, and I never once brought up classes or private sessions during those interactions.

![Pasted image 20250521192545.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192545.png)

What free classes are you referring to?

I came to support the Kizomba community and help create a positive atmosphere for your classes. There were multiple occasions where I stayed for the entire class without participating because there were more leads than followers. I always tried to make sure people had a chance to dance and enjoy the experience. I did pay for the initial sessions.

In your last term before your vacation, I didn’t attend because there weren’t enough followers. But I still came to the last class to play music so people could practice.

I used the space three times to film some videos—roughly 10 hours in total.

If we talk about the classes, that’s about 4 more hours across a month. But every Tuesday, I played music for free for two hours, which more than covers that usage. And during those times, you weren’t even there—you had left.

I also played music at Studio G events two to three times a month, each session lasting about four hours. Let’s round it down to 10 hours per month. I did that for nearly a year.

Melanie said that my compensation was “exposure.” But honestly, she was the one getting exposure—Studio G socials ran smoothly because I took charge and handled everything without asking for anything in return.

And let’s not forget Julz’s workshop—I paid for that out of my own pocket.

![Pasted image 20250521194240.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521194240.png)

Well, you and Melanie could have easily approached me and said something like:

1. “Hey Jonny, if you don’t mind, could you please remove the post about your classes? This group is meant only for Studio G students.”
2. “Hey Jonny, next time please avoid posting content that isn’t related to the group’s purpose.”

Instead, the post was deleted without any communication. I didn’t even realize it had been removed until someone reached out to ask me why it was gone.

When you say I need to “navigate the situation,” I would say the same back to you. I’m not the kind of person who hides things from people.

The real reason you wanted me to delete the post was to avoid looking bad in front of the community. That tells me you’re concerned about your image and trying to protect it.

I, on the other hand, value transparency. I trust people to read the facts and come to their own conclusions.

![Pasted image 20250521192611.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192611.png)

That narrative doesn’t really hold up.

You had just returned from your vacation, and I hadn’t even announced my classes yet. You were the one who announced your group classes first—and only after that did I share mine. I intentionally waited for you to go first because I didn’t want to give the impression that I was trying to compete or take over anything.

To be honest, Melanie was the one who benefited the most. She never had to spend a dime while I invested in a DJ controller, purchased DJ software, and dedicated countless hours preparing and playing music—all so her studio could have people showing up and dancing.

And now, to be labeled as “opportunistic” is disappointing. Just so we’re clear, I’ve decided to cancel my group and private classes. I may host a few practice sessions—which will be completely free.

Because the truth is, I don’t *need* to do this. I don’t need to teach, I don’t need to run socials. I’ve done it all because I care about this community. The only thing I ever asked of Melanie was to have a space where the community could dance, and in order to that i did what i did.

What I find interesting is that the moment I announced my group classes, I was immediately cut off—and then asked not to tell people that it was Melanie who made that request.

You spoke to me about timing and consequences, but how does that sound to you?

My class was originally intended (and remember, I’ve cancelled it) to run on Sundays from 4 to 6 PM—specifically so that we could all head to Studio G afterward and dance at the Sunday social. I was intentionally planning things in a way that would support and help grow the community and Studio G.

I understand that Melanie doesn’t want me to be part of it anymore, and she’s absolutely within her rights to make that decision.

What was difficult for me was the timing and how the situation was handled—it felt really hurtful. We could have easily worked together on a smooth transition for you to take over.
