About a month ago, I reached out to David and told him I was interested in teaching group classes. I specifically asked if he was okay with it, because I didn’t want to be disrespectful in any way.

He said he was fine with it and even encouraged me to go ahead.

After that, I approached Melanie to inquire about renting the space, but she refused.

So, both of them knew this situation was likely to happen.

So, yesterday morning David posted about his classes at the studio in a WhatsApp group.

Around 10 PM, I posted about the group classes I’ll be teaching.

This morning, he reached out to me saying that Melanie, the owner of Studio G, was upset because she felt it was a conflict of interest.

I contacted Melanie, and she told me that it was unethical for me to post there, as the group is meant exclusively for Studio G students.

I explained that I’ve been promoting her studio widely and, since I DJ and teach there for free, I thought it would be okay to post.

According to her, the “compensation” for my efforts is the exposure I receive.

Okay—no harm done.

![Pasted image 20250521103241.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103241.png)

Meanwhile, David deleted my post about the classes.

Some people reached out to him asking why it was removed.

In response, he made a public post clarifying that it was a misunderstanding and that the group is only for promoting Studio G events.

Fine.

Then I asked Melanie if she still wants me to teach this coming Saturday.

![Pasted image 20250521103316.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103316.png)

As you can see, she later informed me that I’m no longer part of Studio G.

So, I made a polite and respectful post letting people know that I’m no longer affiliated with them.

![Pasted image 20250521103349.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103349.png)

Then David asked me to delete the post.

I told him I wouldn’t.

He kept insisting.

![Pasted image 20250521103627.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521103627.png)

So, he took her side and tried to bury the whole situation.

That same day, my freedom of speech was denied twice—even though what I posted was never hateful, disrespectful, or aggressive.

So, I left the group.

That’s the story.

Feel free to talk to the others involved—everyone has their own version.

As for me, I’ve decided I will no longer support Melanie.

![Pasted image 20250521192513.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192513.png)

As I mentioned before, I respectfully disagree with his request to delete my post.

![Pasted image 20250521192530.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192530.png)

2: When I reached out to you about the group classes—especially now that I’m enrolled in the same teaching program that you trained under—there was no mention of me not being ready to teach. I wish you had shared that concern with me earlier.

3: First of all, I only teach because I genuinely want the community to grow. I’ve invested a lot of time and energy into Kizomba, and to be honest, it can be tiring. It would be much easier to simply show up at a social and enjoy dancing like everyone else.

But instead, I dedicate hours preparing personalized mixsets to play at the socials. I spend time researching music to ensure the community has access to quality tunes.

When you say I wouldn’t have access to those students without Studio G, I’d just like to point out that many of those people might not even be here if it weren’t for the work I’ve put in. When I wasn’t running the upstairs social, there was no social at all. The only reason the socials continued for almost a year was because I was there—playing music and making sure people had a space to dance.

As for teaching, I’ve only ever given private lessons to three people, all of whom were already part of your classes. A few others picked up things from me informally, and I never charged for that. I’ve never advertised or promoted my private lessons—only responded when people specifically asked.

The vast majority of people just danced with me, and I never once brought up classes or private sessions during those interactions.

![Pasted image 20250521192545.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192545.png)

I came to support the Kizomba community and help create a positive atmosphere for your classes. There were multiple occasions where I stayed for the entire class without participating because there were more leads than followers. I always tried to make sure people had a chance to dance and enjoy the experience. I did pay for the initial sessions.

In your last term before your vacation, I didn’t attend because there weren’t enough followers. But I still came to the last class to play music so people could practice.

I used the space three times to film some videos—roughly 10 hours in total.

If we talk about the classes, that’s about 4 more hours across a month. But every Tuesday, I played music for free for two hours, which more than covers that usage. And during those times, you weren’t even there—you had left.

I also played music at Studio G events two to three times a month, each session lasting about four hours. Let’s round it down to 10 hours per month. I did that for nearly a year.

I taught three classes before the Saturday night socials, and it was actually Melanie who asked me to do it. For the following two months, I continued offering the class because she mentioned wanting to have something in place before the social.

Once again, I did it with the goal of helping people learn. Before my first class, I even reached out to several community members to ask what challenges they were facing, so I could tailor the class to meet their needs.

Melanie said that my compensation was “exposure.” But honestly, she was the one getting exposure—Studio G socials ran smoothly because I took charge and handled everything without asking for anything in return.

And let’s not forget Julz’s workshop—I paid for that out of my own pocket.

The moment I made a post that didn’t align with Melanie’s preferences, I was cut off. Coincidence?

![Pasted image 20250521194240.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521194240.png)

Well, you and Melanie could have easily approached me and said something like:

1. “Hey Jonny, if you don’t mind, could you please remove the post about your classes? This group is meant only for Studio G students.”
2. “Hey Jonny, next time please avoid posting content that isn’t related to the group’s purpose.”

Instead, the post was deleted without any communication. I didn’t even realize it had been removed until someone reached out to ask me why it was gone.

When you say I need to “navigate the situation,” I would say the same back to you. I’m not the kind of person who hides things from people.

The real reason you wanted me to delete the post was to avoid looking bad in front of the community. That tells me you’re concerned about your image and trying to protect it.

I, on the other hand, value transparency. I trust people to read the facts and come to their own conclusions.

![Pasted image 20250521192611.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250521192611.png)

That narrative doesn’t really hold up.

You had just returned from your vacation, and I hadn’t even announced my classes yet. You were the one who announced your group classes first—and only after that did I share mine. I intentionally waited for you to go first because I didn’t want to give the impression that I was trying to compete or take over anything.

To be honest, Melanie was the one who benefited the most. She never had to spend a dime while I invested in a DJ controller, purchased DJ software, and dedicated countless hours preparing and playing music—all so her studio could have people showing up and dancing.

And now, to be labeled as “opportunistic” is disappointing. Just so we’re clear, I’ve decided to cancel my group and private classes. I may host a few practice sessions—which will be completely free.

Because the truth is, I don’t *need* to do this. I don’t need to teach, I don’t need to run socials. I’ve done it all because I care about this community. The only thing I ever asked of Melanie was to have a space where the community could dance, and in order to that i did what i did.

What I find interesting is that the moment I announced my group classes, I was immediately cut off—and then asked not to tell people that it was Melanie who made that request.

You spoke to me about timing and consequences, but how does that sound to you?

My class was originally intended (and remember, I’ve cancelled it) to run on Sundays from 4 to 6 PM—specifically so that we could all head to Studio G afterward and dance at the Sunday social. I was intentionally planning things in a way that would support and help grow the community and Studio G.

I understand that Melanie doesn’t want me to be part of it anymore, and she’s absolutely within her rights to make that decision.

What was difficult for me was the timing and how the situation was handled—it felt really hurtful. We could have easily worked together on a smooth transition for you to take over.

# About the Group Classes

At first, I had decided to cancel the group classes. However, after speaking with several people, I’ve had a change of heart. I’d like to share the reasoning behind my initial decision.

The Studio G used to be a hub for Kizomba in Hamilton, regularly hosting three socials per month. Occasionally, we also had the Salsa Soul events, which included a dedicated Kizomba room. With Studio G’s recent decision to reduce the number of socials to just once a month, opportunities for practice have become much more limited.

While classes are essential for learning, that one hour of instruction often isn’t enough—not only to absorb the steps but also to gain the confidence to use them. Socials provide the crucial space where students can practice and apply what they’ve learned. That’s why I designed my classes to include 30 minutes of guided practice after instruction.

With only one social per month, students might go through 3 to 4 classes before getting the chance to dance socially, and much of the context may be lost. No matter how many classes someone takes, improvement is difficult without regular practice. For many, socials are the most accessible and motivating way to reinforce their learning.

My concern was that, with fewer socials, offering classes would become less effective—like trying to dry ice. I also heard some feedback that my efforts were being perceived as opportunistic, which was discouraging.

However, some heartfelt conversations with a few of you helped me see things differently. Your encouragement—and your belief in what these classes mean—reminded me why I do this in the first place: because I truly love it.

So, I’ve decided to move forward with the classes. Thank you to those who took the time to share your thoughts with me. Your support means a great deal.

I went to Mississauga for a Urban Kiz class, and someone asked me when the next Kizomba event in Hamilton would be. I explained that I was no longer associated with Studio G, so I wasn’t sure. They asked me what happened, and before I could go into detail, they mentioned that they were friends with David. I responded by saying that nothing I was about to share was a secret; everything had already been made public so that people could draw their own conclusions.

They began by saying that David spoke highly of me and acknowledged how much I was learning and progressing quickly.

I explained what happened to the best of my ability. They listened attentively and respectfully. They also asked thoughtful and important questions, such as:

- “Do you feel ready to teach Kizomba?”

I addressed their questions by explaining that this all started because David was often absent from the scene, and people began approaching me for help. Over time, others started requesting private lessons, which led me to pursue a teaching training program. Naturally, I wanted to put that training into practice.

I also shared that I have a long background in movement, including circus, gymnastics, mime, Contact Improvisation, and professional dance—some of which I’ve also taught. I explained that I genuinely believe I can help people learn the fundamentals of Kizomba.

Lastly, I mentioned that during an informal conversation at a bar, David once told me he didn’t have much more to teach beyond a few tricks. I also acknowledged that I wasn’t sure if he would remember saying that.

- “Is there space for two teachers in Hamilton, considering the scene is still quite small?”

I simply explained that people were coming to me asking for help, and I felt there was a genuine demand, so I decided to set up classes, but I made sure to inform both Melanie and David beforehand.

They also mentioned that, in the past, there was a similar situation before where some people were unhappy, but the argument at the time was that it’s a free market.

They commented that, regardless of how prepared I am, the fact that I’m doing something that brings new people into the dance scene is a good thing.

Lastly, he mentioned that he intended to talk to David and would share any feedback with me the next time we meet.

The next day, I spoke with them over the phone, and they shared the points they had discussed with David.

- David, as an employee of Studio G, was acting on their behalf and carrying out their requests.
- David acknowledged that he told me he didn’t have much else to teach me, but clarified that this doesn’t mean there isn’t more to learn about Kizomba.
- David had no issues with me teaching.
- David believed that I benefited from Studio G just as much as Studio G benefited from me.

They advised me not to burn bridges with David, especially since they didn’t believe he has any personal issues with me. I explained that my main issue was that David spoke to me in a very condescending manner.

I want to thank them for listening to my side of the story and for going out of their way to speak with David as well. I believe everyone deserves to hear both sides of the story.

![Pasted image 20250602234937.png](/img/user/MEDIA/Pasted%20image%2020250602234937.png)

Today, Studio G announced a dedicated Kizomba social event on the main floor.

What I’m about to say is speculative, based on everything that has happened.

When I spoke with David on the phone, he mentioned that he and Melanie had discussed ways to grow the community, and that he suggested bringing in other teachers and DJs. Shortly after that, David went on vacation.

To me, it seems like they had plans to grow the community, and I simply wasn’t part of those plans. I have no issue with bringing in a well-known DJ from our local scene. That could attract a different crowd and hopefully lead to better attendance at events. I just thought I would be included in that process.

David advised me to learn to navigate situations like this more effectively. But I also believe that if their plan was to bring in professional DJs as part of a strategy to grow the community, they could have communicated that with me. They could’ve said something like, “Hey, we’re shifting directions and bringing in DJs for future socials, so there won’t be a need for you to play music.” They could’ve even let me DJ one last time and made a smooth transition.

Instead, as soon as I announced my classes, I was cut off—something I only discovered because I reached out to Melanie myself. She didn’t even extend the courtesy of a phone call to explain the situation. To me, that feels like retaliation for becoming the competition.

I do believe that bringing in professional DJs is a good move to help grow the community. I’m just saddened by the way I was excluded from the process. As I mentioned to two different organizers who inquired about my DJ rates, I told them that I am a dancer first, and if they are looking for a live DJ, I’m not interested.

To me, the saddest part is that I no longer feel welcome at Studio G, and, unfortunately, others have been affected by what happened as well. I also lost the only local place where I could go to dance. What could have been a space to bring people together has now become a source of division.

As I’ve told some people, no one should feel obligated to boycott Studio G because of this situation. If they enjoy being there, they should go and have fun.
