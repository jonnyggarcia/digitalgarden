About a month ago, I reached out to David and told him I was interested in teaching group classes. I specifically asked if he was okay with it, because I didn’t want to be disrespectful in any way.

He said he was fine with it and even encouraged me to go ahead.

After that, I approached Melanie to inquire about renting the space, but she refused.

So, both of them knew this situation was likely to happen.

So, yesterday morning David posted about his classes at the studio in a WhatsApp group.

Around 10 PM, I posted about the group classes I’ll be teaching.

This morning, he reached out to me saying that Melanie, the owner of Studio G, was upset because she felt it was a conflict of interest.

I contacted Melanie, and she told me that it was unethical for me to post there, as the group is meant exclusively for Studio G students.

I explained that I’ve been promoting her studio widely and, since I DJ and teach there for free, I thought it would be okay to post.

According to her, the “compensation” for my efforts is the exposure I receive.

Okay—no harm done.

Meanwhile, David deleted my post about the classes.

Some people reached out to him asking why it was removed.

In response, he made a public post clarifying that it was a misunderstanding and that the group is only for promoting Studio G events.

Fine.

Then I asked Melanie if she still wants me to teach this coming Saturday.

As you can see, she later informed me that I’m no longer part of Studio G.

So, I made a polite and respectful post letting people know that I’m no longer affiliated with them.

Then David asked me to delete the post.

I told him I wouldn’t.

He kept insisting.

So, he took her side and tried to bury the whole situation.

That same day, my freedom of speech was denied twice—even though what I posted was never hateful, disrespectful, or aggressive.

So, I left the group.

That’s the story.

Feel free to talk to the others involved—everyone has their own version.

As for me, I’ve decided I will no longer support Melanie.
