Basic 2 is a side to side step where each step follows the beat of the music. Traditionally, out of convention, the lead always steps to the left and the follower to the right. Then close the lead close the right leg. With the same leg (right), the lead steps to the right.

The close of the legs without changing weight is called a *marca*.

When the lead is moving to the left, they should use their right arm agains the follower's body to indicate direction by gently pushing them. in the same way, when the lead is move to the right, they should use the tip of their fingers to pull the follower to the right.
