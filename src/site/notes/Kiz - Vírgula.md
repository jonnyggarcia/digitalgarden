**Vírgula** (comma) is a change in direction to the left (most common) or right and can be performed with different degrees of rotation:

- **1/4 turn**: Usually just called a 1/4 turn or corner right or left.
- **1/3 turn**
- **1/2 turn** (180-degree turn): Usually referred to as a Vírgula.

The essential part of this move is the chest pivoting to the left to initiate the rotation, followed by a step with the left leg. The step should be in place and should not cause any movement in the follower's body other than the rotation. Once the rotation is completed, the move ends with Basic 2 to the right (marca). When closing the move, the lead should use a gentle pull with their right arm to indicate where the follower should step.

**Lead**
1. Pivot the chest to the left.
2. Step with the left leg in place.
3. Step with the right leg to the right.
4. Close with the left leg (marca).

*Key elements of move*
- The lead should emphasize the pivoting of the chest on step 1.
- When closing the movement (Basic 2), the lead’s right hand should guide the follower to where they should move.
