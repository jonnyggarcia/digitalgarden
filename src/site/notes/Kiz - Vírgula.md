Vírgula (comma) is a change in direction to the left. It can be performed with different degrees of rotation.

- 1/4 turn. Usually just called 1/4 turn.
- 1/3 turn
- 1/2 turn. Usually the word Vírgula refers to the 180 degree turn.

The essential part of this move is the chest movement to the left to create the rotation followed by the left step. The step is in place and should not cause movement in the followers body other than rotation. Once rotation is completed, the move ends with basic 2 to the right (marca). When closing the move, the lead should use the pull with their right arm to indicate to the follower where to step.

1. Chest turn to the left
2. Step with the left leg
3. Right side step to the right
4. Close left (marca)
