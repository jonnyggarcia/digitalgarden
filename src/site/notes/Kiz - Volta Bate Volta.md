**Volta Bate e Volta** (lap, collide, lap) is a variation of the [[Kiz - Volta da Mulher\|Volta da Mulher]] with a break. During this move, the follower walks around the lead until the lead blocks their way, sending them back. The lead then blocks the follower’s path one more time, and the follower finishes the volta.

1. Star by doing the [[Kiz - Volta da Mulher\|Volta da Mulher]].
2. Keep marking the beat by alternating the steps.
3. On step 7, take a left step backward while extending the left hand in front of the follower; this hand should be at the stomach area of the follower. This acts as a block to prevent the follower from moving forward.
4. Take a right step forward.
5. Take a left step sideways.

*Key elements of the move*
- The lead’s arm is extended to the side and only offers resistance to the follower’s momentum. The block is performed by the lead moving in the opposite direction (backward) of the follower.
- Leads need to be careful when extending the arm to avoid touching the follower’s body inappropriately.
