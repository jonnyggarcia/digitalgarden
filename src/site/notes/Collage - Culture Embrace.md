**Context**: Understanding Canadian culture was a challenge that I struggled to adjust to. I recall how difficult it was to make friends. I attempted to participate in various activities where I was the only foreigner, but the majority of those endeavours proved fruitless. The intricate details and unspoken rules of a culture are deeply ingrained in the individuals since birth, creating an agreement that is challenging to grasp as an outsider.
